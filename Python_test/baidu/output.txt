In the first half of this year, female game enthusiasts contributed 24.15 billion yuan to domestic game sales, up 13.5% year on year, according to the report.
China's securities regulator recently issued a statement on improving the delisting system of enterprises.
The revised system states that companies will suspend or terminate stock listing if they act against national security, public safety or public health safety.
This is the first time that companies involved in public health threats will be forced to delist.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission has also made it clear that companies involved in fraud and major information disclosure violations will be suspended or terminated.
China set up a delisting mechanism in 2014, but in March this year, authorities said they needed stricter delisting rules to keep the stock market healthy and protect the interests of small investors.
In May this year, the Shanghai Stock Exchange terminated the listing of two companies, while the Shenzhen Stock Exchange terminated the listing of another company.
SHANGHAI - Starbucks has been the undisputed Coffee King in China for many years.
In a country of tea enthusiasts, it has created a coffee drinker market, making money from a large number of wealthy Chinese who regard Starbucks as an "ideal brand". China quickly became the second largest market for this coffee chain after the United States.
However, as China's economic growth slows down and even competitors try to target coffee drinkers, Starbucks'dominance in China is increasingly being impacted.
On Thursday, to revitalize its business in China, the company announced the establishment of a so-called "new retail" strategic partnership with Chinese technology giant Alibaba.
From December, the tax-free policy of Hainan Province will be further relaxed to promote tourism and domestic consumption.
In a statement posted on its official website, the Ministry of Finance said it would increase the tax-free shopping quota for domestic and foreign tourists and residents of the island from the current 16,000 yuan per person to 30,000 yuan per year, unlimited.
The list of duty-free commodities will add some medical devices, including hearing aids, vision training equipment, household respiratory support equipment and so on.
According to the statement, each person can buy up to two pieces at a time.
Wang Huiping, deputy director of Hainan Provincial Finance Department, said the new changes would help bring more luxury goods to the domestic market and more convenience to tourists. He also said that the new policy would attract more tourists to the island and promote the development of the service industry.
According to the data of Hainan Provincial Government, the total consumption of duty-free commodities in Hainan Province reached 7.95 billion yuan from January to October this year, up 23% from the same period last year.
Last year, tax-free sales in Hainan reached 8.816 billion yuan, up 32% from 2016.
Ed's auction house said Tuesday that part of the original spiral staircase of the Eiffel Tower was bought by a Middle Eastern collector at an auction in Paris for 169,000 euros, three times the original estimate.
This staircase is a private collection from Canada. It contains 25 steps and is 4.3 meters high. It is a staircase between the second and third floors of the Eiffel Tower, a landmark of Paris built in 1889.
When the elevator was installed in 1983, the staircase was removed and cut into 24 sections, ranging in length from 2 meters to 9 meters.
One of them has been kept on the first floor of the Eiffel Tower since then, and three others have been donated to three museums in France.
The other 20 paragraphs were first auctioned on 1 December 1983.
In 2016, an Asian collector bought a staircase of the Eiffel Tower for 523,800 euros, 10 times more than he had estimated.
This pilot project is a way to demonstrate the use of coffee cups for coffee cups. Jay Hunsberger, deputy director of sales in North America at Sustana Old Cup Recycling Paper Mill, said.
In the paper mill, these cups are fully mixed with water, and then the plastic lining inside the cup is separated with a 7-foot screw cone to prevent the cup from getting wet.
The fibers are separated after inspection and cleaning, and then made into paper and sent to WestRock, a packaging company, to make cardboard. In the third processing company, Seda cardboard will be printed with Starbucks logo, shape and make new cups.
"There have been misunderstandings about the recyclability of PVC coated cardboard in the industry." Mike Mueller, Senior Product Marketing Manager at WestRock, said.
"I think this is the biggest obstacle that the packaging can not be recycled in large quantities." WestRock's eight own paper mills recently began accepting the cups, as well as paper food packaging.
Generally speaking, it is considered difficult or expensive to separate the plastic lining from the cup or remove the coffee stains.
But Hunsberger says it's not more expensive than recycling ordinary paper, and it's the same whether it's used or not. Sustana began routinely recycling other coated paper containers, such as milk boxes, before piloting the project with Starbucks.
One of the challenges is supply, which makes it difficult to predict how many cups a paper mill can recycle, making it more difficult for it to operate effectively. But for paper mills, it is not difficult to operate if they are able to recycle cups in a constant proportion.
"It's true that different materials can be handled a little differently, and you need to adjust the process to suit, but if this becomes a long-term material, you just need to adapt to work."
Seattle, New York City, Washington, D.C., and other cities are also recycling cups. The latest coffee cup recycling city is Denver, which recently delivered two trucks of about 88,000 cups to Sustana.
Ten percent of Starbucks'new cups are made from recycled cups, with the goal of doubling them by 2020. If Starbucks decides to collect enough of its own fibre cups, which are in line with the latest trial run, more paper mills and local recycling stations will be needed to collect the cups.
Current paper processing equipment can't be recycled 100% yet, but recycled fibers can reach 40% to 50%. Starbucks and other cafes can target more radically.
In recent days, China has disclosed for the first time the annual return of basic pension fund investment.
The latest data released by the National Council of Social Security Funds (NSSF) show that in 2017, the total investment income of the basic pension fund reached 8.78 billion yuan, with an annual return of 5.23%.
In December 2016, the local government began to commission the Social Security Foundation to operate the investable part of its huge pension asset pool in order to seek higher returns. This is the first time that the Social Security Foundation has announced its annual returns since it was commissioned.
In our country, the local managed pension fund usually exists in the bank or is used to purchase treasury bonds with an annual yield of 2-3%. The returns of these methods are close to the so-called risk-free interest rates, but far below the market average, and are often depreciated by inflation.
Guan Bo, an associate researcher at a public research institute, said: "This income is nearly 2 percentage points higher than the level of risk-free interest rate in the capital market in the same period, and the advantages of fund concentrated investment have been fully demonstrated."
According to the data of the Social Security Foundation, by the end of 2017, the total assets of the basic pension fund were 315.52 billion yuan and the balance of liabilities was 33.62 billion yuan.
Hewlett-Packard is just one of a growing number of companies that integrate marine plastic waste into their supply chains.
HP has announced its intention to join the company alliance called NextWave Plastics. The organization was founded last year by Dell and Lonely Whale, a public welfare organization.
Ellen Jackowski, HP's Director of Global Sustainable Development Strategy and Innovation, said: "Everyone should stand up and help solve the problem of marine plastic waste. Business should do the same, and I think it's incumbent upon business to take the lead.
She said: "A lot of waste is thrown directly on the ground, and they eventually fall into the canal and then into the ocean. They may contain various elements, be filled with mud, have been eroded by salty air, and have a lot of sand. Many of their properties are very different from those you buy in the U.S. plastic recycling market.
Lena Pripp Kovac, IKEA's renewal manager, said: "We want to test the whole process to make sure that the package is really viable, not just looking at the possibilities."
"They will go through all the links - whether this resource can be obtained, whether designers can use it, and it does not conform to our full set of democratic design principles. These are the things we want to test.
Jackowski said: "The key to the whole thing is that our society should treat plastics as wealth, not waste, and now everyone thinks they are waste. How can we create enough demand to make people think of plastic as wealth, not as something they want to lose when they see it?
"Plastic is a great material in itself, but we're a little bit off-track about how it's handled. So, how should we place appropriate links in the right places in society to create enough value? We need to let society reuse these materials instead of just making new ones.
The holiday shopping season in the United States, marked by Thanksgiving and Black Friday, shows that online shopping is gaining popularity as more Americans choose to shop at home on smartphones, while physical store sales and customer traffic are declining.
Adobe Analytics said online sales on Black Friday rose 23.6% year-on-year to a record $6.22 billion. The company tracked transaction data from 80 of the top 100 U.S. Internet retailers.
Adobe Analytics said smartphone end-to-day sales topped $2 billion for the first time this year on Black Friday.
In addition, data from Adobe Analytics show that on Black Friday this year, consumers bought more high-priced goods, such as appliances, furniture and larger electronics, through mobile phones, with an average order value of 8.5% higher than a year ago, reaching $146.
Preliminary data from Retail Next, an analysis firm, show that net sales of physical stores decreased by 4-7% and passenger traffic by 5-9% during Thanksgiving and Black Friday, continuing the trend in recent years.
Data from ShopperTrak, a retail research firm, also showed that the total number of shoppers in the two days fell by 1% compared with the same period last year.
Facing the trade war opened by President Trump, American farmers were confined outside the international market, hit by retaliatory tariffs and lost lucrative contracts.
But Trump's $12 billion rescue plan to compensate farmers for their losses has had little effect in mitigating the impact of red tape and long waiting (inadequate funds).
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, farmers have received only $838 million since the first $6 billion was released in September.
Another $6 billion fund is expected to be available next month. Agriculture Minister Sonny Perdue said the government was unlikely to provide more than $12 billion in additional funding.
The limitations of the plan began to test farmers'patience. The trade war showed no signs of easing. China and the United States were deadlocked, preventing American farmers from entering key markets for soybeans, agricultural equipment and other products.
Europe plans to impose more retaliatory tariffs on American peanut butter and orange juice, while Canada and Mexico continue to impose taxes on American goods, including pork and cheese.
Trump, who has received support in many agricultural states, still insists that his tough attitude on trade issues will ultimately benefit American farmers. "Farmers are resilient and they can plan ahead of time because of market conditions," Perdue reiterated last month.
Volkswagen Group (China) plans to invest more than 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in China in 2019 in cutting-edge areas, including mobile services, electric vehicles and fast charging networks.
The German carmaker hopes to accelerate the transformation through sustained and strong investment, said Joshan Heizmann, president and CEO of Volkswagen Automobile Group in China.
Hezman said it would work with joint ventures and new partners in a range of new areas, including technology and mobile services, to provide such services to Chinese customers.
He said Volkswagen will launch more than 30 new energy vehicles in China in the next two years, half of which will be produced in China.
By 2020, the automaker is expected to deliver about 400,000 new energy vehicles to the Chinese market, and by 2025, that number will soar to about 1.5 million.
Volkswagen's first batch of Chinese electric vehicles based on MEB platform will be put into production in FAW Volkswagen and SAIC Volkswagen's two factories in 2020.
The company will also work with local partners to explore the establishment of a public rapid charging network for electric vehicles in China starting in 2019.
Meanwhile, Volkswagen is accelerating the development of self-driving technology in China. Its brand Audi has obtained L4 self-driving test qualification in Beijing and Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province in eastern China.
The British royal family is facing a "tax nightmare" as U.S. officials investigate whether Megan and Prince Harry, who have millions of pounds, are suspected of tax arrears.
The Duchess of Sussex (Megan) is still an American citizen and must pay taxes in the United States, which may involve anyone who gives Megan financial support, including her husband, Prince Harry.
This will shrink Megan's $5 million fortune in the United States and Harry's annual earnings of 300,000 from trust funds. The trust fund is Harry's main source of private wealth and pays income tax in the UK.
Royal aides told the Sunday Express that the investigation might even involve the Queen and Prince Charles, who provided financial support to the Harries. The newspaper reported that the royal family would hire a team of financial advisers from the United States to deal with the problem.
"We are facing financial risks that the royal family has never faced before," said a royal aide.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Agency has long been known for its strict tracking of American citizens who they believe are in arrears.
Kensington Palace rejected the Daily Mail's request for comment.
Before the Nazi Party came to power, Albert Einstein wrote a letter warning of the rising dangers of nationalism and anti-Semitism. The letter was recently photographed for nearly $40,000.
Kedem said the previously unknown letter was taken by an anonymous collector in Jerusalem last Tuesday night for $39,360.
In 1922, the German Jewish Foreign Minister was assassinated by right-wing extremists. Einstein wrote this letter to his sister while hiding.
At that time, police warned the Jewish scientist that his life might also be in danger.
In his letter, Einstein wrote: "The dark period of German economy and politics is brewing, so I am glad to be able to get rid of all this."
Kedem said the letter was sold at about twice its estimated price.
Recently, a rare pink diamond was sold at an auction for 5.3 million Swiss francs, setting a record carat unit price.
The diamond, named Pink Heritage and weighing about 19 carats, was purchased by American diamond brand Harry Winston at an auction in Geneva.
According to Christie's European headquarters, the diamond costs about $2.6 million per carat, setting a world record for pink diamonds.
It was priced between $30 million and $50 million and was bought only five minutes after bidding.
The new owner of the diamond renamed it Winston Pink Heritage.
Rahul Kadakia, director of Christie's International Jewelry, said the Oppenheimer family diamond, once owned by De Beers Mining, was "one of the greatest diamonds in the world".
"You may not see a carat of pink diamonds," Kadakia said. But this one is about 19 carats and pink. It's unbelievable."
On Thursday, the electric wheelchair used by the late British physicist Stephen Hawking was sold at an auction for nearly 300,000 pounds ($391,740), while a paper by the late British physicist sold for almost twice the price of the electric wheelchair, which will be donated to charity.
Hawking is famous for exploring the origin of the universe. He spent most of his life in a wheelchair because of motor neuron disease. In March this year, Hawking died at the age of 76.
Some of his personal belongings, including essays, medals, prizes and a brief history of time with his thumbprint, have been auctioned online recently. There were also letters and manuscripts from Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein.
Hawking's 117-page paper The Nature of Cosmic Expansion, published in 1965, was sold for 584,750, far more than previously estimated 150,000.
In addition, Hawking's medals were valued at 15,000, for 296,750, for red electric wheelchairs at 15,000 and for 296,750.
The nine-day online auction, called Standing on the Shoulders of Giants, was held by Christie's Auction House to raise funds for the Hawking Foundation and the Motor Neuron Disease Association.
"Stephen Hawking is influential all over the world and has a unique ability to interact with people," Thomas Vinning, director of books and manuscripts at Christie's Auctions in London, said before the event.
Last Sunday, on the day of the double-11 retail carnival, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba sold 213.5 billion pounds (24 billion pounds) in 24 hours, but the annual growth rate of the event fell to its lowest level ever.
Before dawn, online shoppers from China to the world began to rush to buy hot-selling products such as apple phones, furniture and milk powder. According to statistics, sales exceeded $10 billion an hour after 0:00.
Singles Day, also known as Double 11, is one of the world's largest online sales events, with more sales than Black Five and Cyber Monday combined in the United States.
Shuang11 was first used by Chinese students to celebrate single festivals as a way to combat Valentine's Day, but it gradually evolved into a month-long online shopping festival, with its peak at 0 a.m. on the day of Shuang11.
This year, it took Alibaba less than 16 hours to break the 168 billion yuan of full-day sales last year.
Despite the astonishing record, the annual growth rate is expected to fall from 39% to 27%, the lowest in 10 years.
Earlier this month, the company predicted a 4-6 percentage point decline in its annual sales, which undoubtedly worsened its share price.
"On Sunday, sales of small appliances and cosmetics were strong, while sales of large appliances in the home market showed a downward trend." Cai Chongxin, vice president of Alibaba, said in an interview.
"If people don't buy new houses, they won't buy household appliances."
According to the China International Import Exposition Bureau, the six-day China International Import Commodity Fair closed in Shanghai on Saturday with a total intention of closing $57.8 billion.
The expected turnover of high-end smart devices is more than $16.5 billion, while that of consumer electronics and household appliances is about $4.3 billion.
The expected trade volume of automobile exhibition area is about 12 billion US dollars.
Clothing and consumer goods exhibition area sales are about 3.4 billion US dollars, food and agricultural products sales are about 12.7 billion US dollars.
The expected volume of transactions in medical devices and health products is about US$5.8 billion, while the volume of trade in services is about US$3.2 billion.
China International Import Expo Bureau said that the agreement reached by the countries and regions related to the "one belt and one road" proposal is worth about $4 billion 700 million.
3617 companies from 151 countries and regions demonstrated their products at the Expo.
Preliminary statistics show that at least 570 new products, technologies or services have been released for the first time in mainland China or globally.
During the "Double Eleventh" 24-hour online retail Carnival last Sunday, Alibaba Group, the domestic e-commerce giant, set a record of 213.5 billion yuan in turnover.
On that day, the total turnover of Alibaba Platform (including Tianmao and Taobao) increased by about 27% compared with 168.2 billion yuan last year.
In only 2 minutes and 05 seconds, sales of Tianmao website exceeded the 10 billion yuan mark, setting a record of 3 minutes and 01 seconds last year.
The most expensive buyers came from Shanghai, followed by buyers from Beijing, Hangzhou and Guangzhou.
According to Alibaba, more than 19,000 overseas brands from 75 countries and regions participated in China's online shopping Carnival this year.
Health care products are the most popular imported products. Milk powder, diapers and skin care products also rank top on consumers'shopping lists.
Zhang Yong, chief executive of Alibaba Group, said that the surge in turnover showed "consumers'continued pursuit of upgrading their daily life style".
The World Bank Group's annual business environment report released Wednesday said that China has now become one of the top 50 economies in the business environment because of record number of reforms implemented last year to improve the business environment.
"China has implemented the largest number of reforms in the East Asia-Pacific region, and its global ranking has jumped sharply from 78th last year to 46th this year," the report said.
Hao Fuman, Director of China Bureau of the World Bank, said: "In the past year, China has made rapid progress in improving the business environment for domestic SMEs, which reflects the great importance attached by the Chinese government to fostering innovation and private enterprises."
According to the report, China's reform in reducing administrative red tape has made it one of the top ten global improvers this year.
The progress made in the establishment of enterprises and access to electricity is particularly impressive.
Since last year, three procedures have been abolished, so it now takes only nine days to start a business, on a par with most high-income OECD countries.
In terms of power access, it is also free in China at present. Japan and the United Arab Emirates are the only other two countries in the world with this characteristic.
Despite record results, Apple's share price fell 7% in after-hours trading on Thursday, causing its market value to fall below the trillion-dollar mark.
The technology giant's strategy of charging higher fees for its mobile phones has worked, and revenue has continued to grow over the past three months despite relatively stable sales.
The company's revenue grew 20% year-on-year to $62.9 billion, and its total profit grew 31% to $14.1 billion.
But a forecast of weak sales in the coming months has triggered a decline in its share price after official trading.
The selling accelerated after Apple said it would stop disclosing sales.
Apple executives defended their decision, arguing that the data were no longer a good indicator of the company's financial position.
But some analysts warned that outsiders might see this as a cover-up.
The total number of smartphones sold by all manufacturers worldwide fell for the first time in 2017. But Apple's strategy of setting higher prices for its phones helped the company survive a slump in the market.
The company sold 46.9 million iPhones in the third quarter, up slightly from 46.7 million in the same period last year.
American companies added 250,000 jobs last month, and average wages rose at the fastest rate in nearly 10 years to attract and retain employees.
The Ministry of Labor's monthly employment report will be the latest major economic data before the mid-term elections on November 6. It also shows that the unemployment rate has remained at a five-year low of 3.7%.
New job seekers have brought the proportion of working Americans to its highest level since January 2009.
Consumer confidence index is also the highest in 18 years, and their large expenditure is driving rapid economic growth. The U.S. economy is entering its tenth year of growth, the second longest period on record, and October saw a record 100th consecutive month of job creation.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said at the opening ceremony of a large-scale trade fair Monday that China will take measures to expand market access opportunities. At the same time, China has been criticized by other countries for its economic and commercial activities.
Xi said that China would reduce tariffs, take more measures to punish infringement of intellectual property rights, and strive to promote domestic consumption of imported goods.
At the China Import Expo held in Shanghai, Xi Jinping promised that China would "embrace the world" as the world's second largest economy promoted its growing consumer market.
He did not mention the name of President Trump, but criticized isolationism, pointed out the need to safeguard multilateral trade and alluded to President Trump's "American Priority" policy.
The United States and China are locked in a trade war. Trump is dissatisfied with the US trade deficit with China, accuses China of stealing intellectual property rights and formulates policies that make it more difficult for American companies to enter the Chinese market.
Trump announced an increase of $250 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, while China imposed $110 billion in tariffs on American products. Xi and Trump are expected to meet later this month.
The EU also complained about China's trade policies, including criticism of Xi's failure to fulfil earlier reform commitments. Last week, the European Union called on Xi Jinping to propose concrete steps to open the market.
According to the World Bank's Business Environment Report 2019: Strengthening Training and Promoting Reform, China has implemented a record number of reforms to improve business environment for SMEs in the past year, ranking among the top 10 in the world in terms of business environment improvement this year.
In East Asia and the Pacific, China has implemented the largest number of reforms. As a result, China's global business environment ranking jumped from 78 last year to 46.
Hao Fuman, Director of China Bureau of the World Bank, said: "In the past year, China has made rapid progress in improving the business environment of domestic SMEs. This progress has made China one of the 50 largest economies in the world, and also shows that the government attaches great importance to fostering entrepreneurship and private enterprises.
So, in what areas has China made significant progress? The World Bank believes that China has made remarkable progress in the reform of seven categories, namely, enterprise establishment, construction permit processing, access to electricity, taxation and cross-border trade. Among them, China has made remarkable progress in establishing enterprises and obtaining electricity.
In terms of starting enterprises, China has made it more convenient to start enterprises by introducing an online registration system and simplifying the social security registration process.
In terms of "access to electricity", China has reduced the time of receiving electricity from 143 days to 34 days by expanding its network capacity and providing free access services, as well as introducing customer-oriented mobile app.
China has made significant progress in the two areas of "start-up enterprises" and "access to electricity". Since last year, three procedures have been abolished in both areas, and it now takes only nine days to start a business, which is on par with the average in most high-income OECD countries. In addition, Beijing is one of the only two cities in the world where businesses are completely free.
China's electricity service is also completely free. Japan and the United Arab Emirates are the only countries in the world that receive electricity free of charge.
In terms of "processing construction permits", China not only makes it more convenient to apply for construction permits, complete acceptance procedures and real estate registration of new buildings, but also imposes stricter qualification requirements on construction professionals, and improves public access to information, thus strengthening construction quality control.
In the area of "registered property", the "registered property" is more convenient by simplifying the management procedures and enhancing the reliability and transparency of the land management system.
In the aspect of protecting minority investors, the protection of minority investors is strengthened by strengthening the rights and roles of shareholders in major corporate decisions, clarifying ownership and control structures, and requiring reimbursement of legal expenses incurred by shareholders.
In terms of tax payment, by abolishing business tax, all stamp tax declarations and payments can be allowed jointly, and by implementing a number of administrative reforms, tax compliance time can be shortened to make "tax payment" more convenient.
In terms of "cross-border trade", the time and cost of "cross-border trade" are reduced by implementing "single window", eliminating administrative charges, enhancing transparency and encouraging competition.
China has made remarkable progress in almost all areas of cross-border trade. For example, the cost of import border compliance has been reduced from $745 to $326.
In resolving business disputes, China takes 496 days on average, accounting for 16% of the claims. It ranks among the best economies in the world, better than the OECD average of high-income economies (582 days and 21%) and ranks sixth in the world.
Although China's business environment has made remarkable progress in the past year, there is still much room for improvement in the field of "processing construction permits" (ranking 121st). In China, enterprises need to complete 20 procedures for building a warehouse to handle all licenses and authorizations, compared with an average of 15 in the East Asia Pacific region. However, thanks to the latest progress in the building quality control index, China's performance has approached the OECD high-income economies'standard, scoring 11 out of 15 points.
"We will be very cautious about marijuana," Johnston said in an interview.
"But I can't disclose any plans of our company in this field at present."
But he said the company would "spare no effort to find growth points."
"To be fair, we focus on all opportunities, but we don't have any plans right now," Johnston said.
At 9:4 a.m. New York time, Pepsi shares fell 1.7% to $108.88.
The focus of cannabis beverage is not tetrahydrocannabinol, which is a psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. Coca-Cola is not interested in it. Research has focused on cannabinol, which has been widely used in health products. Bloomberg said the drink would help ease inflammation, pain and spasm.
Cannabis beverages are seen as potential growth areas for carbonated beverages and spirits companies, which have encountered bottlenecks in product sales.
Canada will legalize cannabis on October 17 after both houses of Parliament voted to use cannabis for recreational purposes.
The rich are getting richer and richer in number.
According to an annual survey released by UBS and PricewaterhouseCoopers, there were 332 new billionaires worldwide last year, and their accumulated wealth grew 19% to a record $8.9 trillion.
What is behind this phenomenon? It is China's explosive wealth creation.
There were only 16 billionaires in China in 2006. But in 2017, China's number of billionaires reached 373, accounting for one-fifth of the world's billionaires.
The United States remains the region with the largest number of billionaires, with 585 billionaires, but the pace of wealth creation in the region is slowing.
The United States added 53 billionaires in 2017 and 87 billionaires in 2012.
In China, 106 new billionaires were added in 2017, equivalent to an average of one new billionaire every three days.
The Renminbi fell to its lowest level in 10 years against the dollar on Monday, close to a politically sensitive figure of 1 to 7.
The Renminbi fell to 6.9644 against the dollar at noon, breaking its last low in 2016, and then recovered slightly. But this is the lowest level since May 2008.
The weakness of the yuan is one of a series of factors that have led Washington to be dissatisfied with Beijing's trade policy. The U.S. Treasury Department did not list China as a currency manipulator this month, but said it was paying close attention to Beijing.
At one time, the Chinese authorities promised to avoid "competitive devaluation" of the renminbi in order to promote exports in the wake of the tariff war with the Trump Administration of the United States. But China is trying to make the state-controlled exchange rate more sensitive to the market, and market forces are pushing the renminbi down.
Although the dollar has no economic significance for the 1-7 exchange rate of the RMB, it may cause the US to pay attention to the exchange rate again.
Mizuho Bank said in a report Monday that the Chinese authorities may "stick to their positions" to prevent "one to seven exchange rate failures".
Since April this year, as China's economy has cooled, interest rates in the United States and China have reversed, and the renminbi has fallen by nearly 10% against the dollar. This helps exporters cope with a 25% tariff on billions of dollars of Chinese goods imposed by the Trump government. But that raises the risk that the United States will complain about Beijing's trade strategy.
A US Treasury Department report on Oct. 17 said China failed to meet the criteria for being a currency manipulator, but said Beijing, along with Japan and Germany, was on the government's list of closely watched monetary policies. Once listed as a currency manipulator, sanctions may arise.
The devaluation of the renminbi may also drive capital outflows from the world's second largest economy. This will lead to higher borrowing costs as Chinese leaders try to support the already cooling economy.
The People's Bank of China has been striving to improve the efficiency of its exchange rate mechanism by increasing the role of the market.
The exchange rate of RMB is set every morning, and its daily fluctuation against the US dollar cannot exceed 2%. The central bank can buy or sell Renminbi, or order Chinese commercial banks to do so, to curb price changes.
Some forecasters say Beijing's position may change if President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping do not make any progress during the Group of 20 summit in November.
