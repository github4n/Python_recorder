Go ahead that way.
All the way over here, Mt. Melbourne. Twice as far and the opposite direction.
Through there.
Force it in until he can bear no more.
Guard: straight on through.
All the way in the back, all the way in the back.
Just down the hall. Thanks.
We can stay there until next Tuesday. And I have the perfect camping spot.
And stay UIL you deliver the baby.
On the East side until closing.
Get myself straight for Sunday morning.
When until dawn,
And stay till it gets dark.
And stay until you deliver the baby.
Until we built out Mosul.
Stay there till I return.
And stay there until I tell you to leave?
I stayed until the end.
Then stay till graduation. Okay
Just until I can figure a few things out.
Covering the same place gets us in a rut.
Stay in the right lane and don't go above 20.
I went home and I stayed home. You didn't tell your wife?
The group session.
For the past seven years.
He was always out and about.
Stay right here until we can get somewhere better.
For good, huh?
While you turninto an old fossil.
You must be tired staying here this late.
Spent all his time there.
I want you to stay there
Until power comes back. Great.
And you're staying on the road until I see profit.
The whole entire time, and meanwhile my aunt was remodeling her house,
It never gets any easier.
Was very unhappy, very angry.
Always professional.
Always glad to see me, aren't you, fellas?
Always the optimist.
It's always messy, primarily because of you.
Always good, just never good enough.
About his new job,
I've really been working hard.
Always sweet.
With this investigation.
More all the time.
I had the biggest crush on him.
Liked playing doctor so much,
Always loved fire.
Always liked the place.
The world's ass for centuries
That's been bothering you. Right?
Always have.
Generous with her time and talents.
I've been okay.
Always, darling.
Top - shelf all the way.
I've always been curious to try.
So far so good, no problems, no birth defects,
I'm always alone.
You know, it's been real quiet and I haven't seen anyone by here
It's been really quiet. L haven't seen anybody down here.
It's been easy, until now.
I always am.
It has been carefully planned, we will surprise everyone.
It's been busy.
You been keeping busy? Uh, quite busy,
I've been busy. Did you find what you were looking for?
always in a hurry. You're lovely.
DOM was still pissed and
I always miss you.
As a member of the professional media.
I've been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.
Been expecting you.
I'm always thankful for your care.
Always worried.
Always about the work.
In the recent past.
He's very driven.
I've really been looking forward to singing for you all,
Been looking forward to this, sir. Yes, I know.
Was dying to meet Blaine.
There's been a complication. The target's still in play.
He's always an ass, but he's very rarely just wrong.
Always special.
For a masquerade ball.
I'm in pain all the time.
And is it constant or does it come and go?
About what to do regarding his vision.
At all times, did he not?
Important to us.
doesn't get any easier.
It's always tough, huh?
It's just hard to believe this is actually my life.
It's never easy to say.
Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.
And never getting a chance.
Always looking over your shoulder.
To a home where there was constant care.
It's on repeat. It'll stay on till we get home.
Keep smiling?
Keep smiling, keep shining
Stood right up and talked to her.
And bided my time until I could get out of there, which
And I never forgot them.
Just haven't gotten around to getting rid of it yet.
I've been a little busy with the trial.
Keep earning money.
Laboring to finish.
Been too busy saving the world from bad guys.
Too busy whoring around and getting fucked up now.
I've been so busy meeting people. I even got invited to parties this weekend.
Been busy losing your virginity then?
He was too busy practicing surgery on his chicken
It's been a good friend
All the time? No, but.
Always happy and smiling.
Run it fast forward.
Until he died.
In your sleep last night?
Ignoring me.
There's an ongoing hostility.
They fought me the whole way, but in the end I was right.
Doing what?
Through with what?
Always hated them.
Before he was shot.
And the guilt of what I've done
She's been suffering from chronic depression.
Pending and unresolved.
This was never adjudicated.
And being worked up all the time never got anyone pregnant.
Continuing to punish me is fine.
I've been waiting for a moment alone to take a closer look at the photo
Always wanted, but found out I couldn't.
Trying to figure out how they came up short.
Can't stop thinking.
I keep thinking why is the dopa at 17 and not 20,
All the time, my beloved.
All the time and I always will.
I've always wanted to live by the sea.
That's all I do.
All. The. Time.
Thinking of you always, Robert.
Rushed for this whole thing to happen.
I tried to be a gracious person
All of the little things that I never had time for.
You know, have sex all the time?
She tried to be a copywriter but got turned down.
Always wanted to get "tron" ed.
To check it out more anyway.
Always wanted to be in that kind of book. Oh, misery manuals.
Keep thinking I'm gonna go someplace more authentic,
I kept meaning to come to new York and visit.
Always wanted 'em! But my mom never made' em.
Been dreaming of burgers. Hey.
Like I wanna throw up all the time.
Always wanted to, but I found out I couldn't.
We can finally do all the things we always said we wanted to do if we lived alone.
Thinking that she actually meant it,
I've been wanting to talk. Me too.
Wondering if maybe if the gun hadn't been there.
It's always been on the list.
Been wanting to do for days.
Always wanted to build a log cabin.
I always wanted to be an engineer.
Still trying to get the baby.
He'd been trying to fix it quietly
Has been barking up my tree.
Going to bring her back.
He keeps coming to us for more money.
Think of me all the time. I think of you.
And I was thinking how long since I'd looked at you.
Always wanted me to have a child
L `ve been trying to call my wife. Would you stop touching me?
Over the part of me that wants to kick your ass all the time. Whoa. What's going on here?
For a chance at redeeming myself,
I was hoping I'd have a chance to talk to you.
Desperately trying to find some type of way to apologize.
I've been trying to find the right time to tell you. I can't believe this.
Who want a big power struggle trying to squeeze him out.
Tried to claw her eyes out.
I've been meaning to give this back to you.
Kept trying to pull you back. You just kept saying, "let me go."
I've really been meaning to get off my chest!
Keep meaning to changed it, but it's a lot of paperwork.
L want us to be close again.
When I was thinking about how to improve my relationship with him,
Always trying to save their own people.
Always wanted a cucumber to call my very own.
Want to put on a good show
And I always wanted to see the falls.
And always wanted to destroy?
Always wanted to use one to light a cigar.
Been wondering what that looks like.
Always wanted to see them.
~ and I keep thinking... ~
Thinking he got away with treating me like crap.
 all the t - I - I - IME
Dreaming of you.
All the while knowing that there's a paint pellet out there with your Namen it.
It was always, like, Nepal or Uganda.
To be thinking about sex
And I... I've been thinking about our futures
Knowing I could have been with her?
With your suicidal tendencies to notice. What?
Always thinking I'd get another chance to do them.
Always think of the now. No time to look back, no time to say how.
Keep new York in your head and work hard.
Keep thinking I'm gonna go someplace more authentic, you know, like Portland.
Actually, I wanted to apologize.
Constantly trying to please. She judges herself harsher than anyone.
I kept thinking about this ghost.
Always wondered why you never cut more of my songs.
And I've always wondered if I'm any good.
To play tennis for nine years,
Been meaning to call you.
Trying to come up with a story.
Kept asking, though.
Always wanted one of my own.
Always wanted one.
 all the more for that
Really? "Always"?
Have been meaning to tell you, um.
Telling us this entire time.
Always wanted to. I hear it's amazing.
To keep going back up to medical
Who keep trying to kill me.
We've always said a change would be nice.
Wants to meet you.
Is trying to drive you away, and - and it's not because.
I was hoping I'd run into you.
You should be looking at.
I was wondering about you. So lovely to see you.
I always wanted him to take me.
And trying to put back in prison for good.
Always wanted you to have this for the right girl.
Was trying to get her to move on with her life,
Always wanted to try one.
Always wanted to test - drive a Lamborghini.
You really wanted to get out,
She keeps asking me to join her.
I've been meaning to say thank you.
Always wanting to go away.
I've been meaning to introduce you to.
Always wanted to say that.
Kept meaning to walk in.
One question never got answered.
I've been wanting to ask you something.
I've been meaning to ask you have you lost some weight?
Always "means before the killings, the arrest, the trial.
You felt my pain, too?
Always be grateful.
Keep feeling better.
It's kind of strange without all the kids.
Opening up a bottle like this.
It keeps getting weird and... Huh.
I felt something was wrong.
Always felt like tap dancers has been on the outside looking in,
Slow all the way.
Since you got here.
All the time mocking, mocking, mocking.
Always. I'll always Protect you.
I did all the talking. He would just sit and listen.
Providence found me a warm home
All along, I'm gonna make, make it right.
This whole time, I thought I broke your heart.
All my life I've only been pretending
And the whole time, I'm worried I might forget something.
I can manage it myself usually.
On the wagon until today, I guess.
And you keep doing battle until you are finished with it, and it is finished with you.
He never stood to ease his breast with panting.
Just until you make good on your promise.
Wear it until you love it!
And die in it.
At all times.
Always pretending to be somebody else.
It's not healthy to keep a hat on all the time.
Had masks on the whole time?
Has been looking forward to in months. Well, so what's the problem?
You can count them on the fingers of one hand, my good woman.
How can a hand move by itself?
Fasten it all the way up the calf. Right.
The cab didn't show and I had to wait cos I was on the bike.
Keep trying to reach him on his mobile.
I won't stop until he kills me.
Kept calling your cell phone, there was no answer.
Until judgment day and trumpets sound?
Beat him till he was in his mama's kitchen.
All the way in the middle of the parking lot?
All the way to the river.
Would the expression "keep on shooting until you run out of ammunition
Over and over till your arm weakens?
Sources, Martin they told me you've been in retirement
So keep it going. Stay in it.
Four tight whacks, no food or water till she came to her senses
You punched her in the face until she bled.
All the time. Atta boy. Atta boy. Atta boy.
He just kept hitting me.
I'm really sorry to keep imposing on you.
He kept interrupting everybody,
She kept calling the radio,
New friend "Clyde" that keeps calling and calling.
Keep calling until she does. Yes, sir.
And called, and then the sheriff came by this morning.
And keep on calling her until she picks up.
Been throwing my name around, harassing people?
Had been planning his film version of the Margaret Mitchell novel
Planning on it. Just waiting 'til I'm 70, sir.
Lightning!
She's through docking us we owe her money at the end of the day.
The obsession that that drug really could work.
couldn't let it go.
Diffuse abdominal tenderness.
If you go on, you'll
don't you ever get tired of always playing the bad cop?
Could never find the right moment.
Never could find the bodies, so I couldn't build a case.
Seek and you shall find.
All the way to the house?
That leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me.
You've been looking for something.
And has suffered alone ever since.
And suffering and then death.
Been making a mess,
If you keep getting them
Before they popped him twice in the head?
I was towing him into shore.
I always regarded him as my older brother.
It's dragging you down.
The fuck he kept you around all this time.
Keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times.
And try to delay it until the pay restraint.
Thread it up to his coronary artery,
Push the straw down to the root beer at the bottom,
keeping me on tenterhooks till the last moment. Why?
And kept backing me in a corner, like I was the one who was cheating.
And drank himself to death.
All this time you've been hiding this beautiful woman from us?
Are putting their money into developing drugs that treat symptoms.
Kept just missing him.
Citing something about their high expectations.
I can't hold on forever
To shut up about it.
Until about the day he retired, at age 33.
But we get to keep shooting until one of us misses.
So they kept getting discounted, so they don't make any difference.
Like gnaw, gnaw. Why? Why didn't he?
They've been gnawing away at me.
Moving my hand on him in his pants.
And plugs into so many outlets,
Of all that is great and righteous.
I felt guilty for years.
A false reading, so my car wouldn't start.
Always complaining.
They complained the entire time.
Have you spoken with regret for having journeyed with us?
was? - what kind of work? I'm sorry!
I am sorry to keep apologizing, but I need to take care of this.
Until it reaches the black sea 1,700 miles away.
All the way to the pyramid.
It was a difficult time.
By going to the end of the deck you're always going to undo
I have been retained to represent Joe Carroll.
Always worrying about something
And the idea that he would find her.
Part of me always worried about what became of him.
Always afraid he'd get into trouble with his temper,
I was worried that she was gonna come in here and disconnect one of the tubes or something.
And finish at that point
Keep going, keep going.Keep going.
Been able to keep hanging on.
Pull through to cheek,
He was repeatedly rejected by the fire department.
And I always refused his money
Have refused to confirm or deny the rumors.
We put it off until today. Then we couldn't do anything.
Was really not shaped until well into the post-production process.
It trailed all over the floor.
I did not arrive here until 4:00 in the morning.
With a long extension cord.
And then it travels all the way.
Hold out until the girls are gone.
To there.
Rallied the eagles to the playoffs.
Been putting it off. Personal reasons.
That was weighing me down.
Been in custody here ever since.
Hold your block until the whistle blow. Hold it!
Just keep turning, all right?
For nagging you about Angela.
All the way to the car.
You carry it until we get on the plane, OK?
You've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along.
What, the whole time? And then I was trying to put that bloody tent up.
Not too tired, holding the camera?
I keep picking up this wretched card.
For the rest of my life.
Works with that kind of thing all the time.
It goes on for 21 days.
It keeps on going.
On and on and on.
For 11 consecutive nights.
For more than 40 years,
It was like that for maybe six weeks or so.
That continue until 13:52.
Until three nights ago.
Through the final years of George's reign.
Which lasted to the day he died.
And they don't stop until it's sold.
Until the evening shadow fell,
It went on and on into the night.
It continued after she left.
And It's just going to go on and on until we stop pretending
And fondle you right through my coffee.
Right on through Tuesday
Slept right through her graduation.
It goes till dawn.
And it's still going on.
As long as it lasts.
For how long? Forever.
It ran on and on. No sweat.
It's starting now,
He talk about it all of the time.
Always leave them hanging.
Just hang here until someone finds us.
Point the way to the stone of tears,
She kept pointing to men around the room
Living up to their expectations.
don't stop. Keep pressing!
Put pressure on it.
I kept hitting snooze.
Just keep pressing n, we want to keep those missiles on the ground.
And ring it and ring it and ring it until they answer.
They're obligated to protocols. Make it personal.
And massage your heart back to life with his bare hands.
Push it till they come in here.
Keep pressure on it. We'll be right back.
Look, keep constant pressure on this wound, okay?
Drowned her in it, held her under until she stopped moving.
Straight down the line! couldn't fault it! Well done! Well done!
For playing by the rules this whole time.
Keep digging. Keep digging!
Dig your way straight down to China.
It grinds along into the northwest corner of the hotel, here.
Keep it moving there, lads.
Tighter, tighter, tighter, till I tell you to stop.
goes Bob, Bob, bobbing along
Stick the bust out.
Channel surf?
Rides right into the sea.
I'm losing my hair. I'm fat and repulsive.
And I'm gonna squeeze until it breaks.
It stretches out the door and around the block.
As far as the eye can see, and then there's a cliff and the ocean.
As it plunges into the depths of the glacier.
Nothing yet.
As anything other than a test of our ingenuity and our endurance,
subject continues to retreat emotionally.
And make out until finals are over?
They keep going close to gimbal lock. I keep losing radio signal.
They keep going close to gimbal lock. I keep losing radio signal.
Always close to death, but never touched by it.
Keep pumping, pumping, pumping, till something comes up.
Until it is like a peeled egg
And you keep hitting him until you break his nose.
Refer to him all the time,
He kept saying her name.
Until it reaches your eyes.
Constantly mentioning their children,
To remind you of how ugly you are?
To remind her of that along the way.
Reminding me of the truth.
Push the straw down to the root beer
No, don't stop stirring, the bottom will burn!
Keep whisking till it's light and frothy!
I have searched... 'till I found you.
Never got that.
I can't really figure out this calendar.
And you've been partying and avoiding me and lying,
And we keep on hurting them till they're gone.
Must have been rough moving around so much.
Keep h0ld 0f her. Just fucking bite d0wn, OK?
It was staring me in the face.
Kept fiddling with something in his hand
To rock till the morning light, all right?
Just keep shaking that Bush.
Till the moment that you had to get in your car and drive here and tell me about it?
He kept on touching, at last he tore my dress.
Keep playing it until he tells us what we want to know.
One time, doing time, for a long time.
Is off the charts.
Lying to your friend's face about having the treasure all this time?
For supporting you, giving you a home, and getting you a job,
made it all the way to the hospital. Died of internal bleeding.
They were just supportive.
And she's my rock.
You are always to stand by my side,
Always supportive, always proud of me.
Who's always been at my side.
Who have supported me in the past year, nor am I the only sponsor.
always having my back.
Always tried to be there for him.
And have always been there for me. Happy birthday.
We're not getting channel four at all.
Starting two weeks ago.
Long - time listeners, first - time.
Yeah, I'll keep them until I'm an old man.
Always changed his M.O., never used the same weapon twice.
And I straightened myself out.
Just keep digging it in there, digging it in.
Just keep a tape on?
Put it in a storage shed.
In your freezer?
Keep it in my wallet
I kept it in my room.
In the box, beside the stove, where they always are.
That had been in our synagogue.
It was in the garage under two tons of old newspapers.
Where it was kept.
From visiting his family in Connecticut.
It was in storage. I think it's 100 years old.
Had our share of disagreements over the years.
Who is this guy who keeps saving us?
What about the times that you saved us from these people?
keeping me alive until the paramedics arrived.
Bestowed on him the most glorious blow job of all time.
I mean, like, counting the days excited.
Till you open this door!
Hit me in the head until I pull it all together.
Shaking him down.
Just keep hitting that valve.
You can punch those buttons till you're blue in the face.
Just leave it on. You have to.
Ineffective against them.
You keep fighting.
Right until the end.
Obliquely down the inner side of the left thigh. Yes.
All that squinting - it can't be good for you.
Off and on?
Let's say a new bee
Thanks to the power of the thumb.
It rounded and became oval
And spin round and round in circles until we puke.
With no one to touch it, had been touched,
The whole time. No rest, no peace.
I went without money and sex. What a joke!
Kept missing it,
And we couldn't confirm that.
L found no other reference to this phenomenon.
I have been unable to access any of the core systems,
For the past month or two.
Who always serves her crueIty.
After the accident.
And he never woke up, so it's not looking good.
She was in a coma up until yesterday.
She's been delirious ever since.
Zero for a lifetime.
This is just going to be 100.
Was he alone like me?
You were all alone? Plenty of time you'd be alone.
A total southern gentleman all the way.
It's always a woman that gets him out of trouble.
Is a mystery,
Always such a good dog.
It always the same rules. They always apply.
Always. Always.
All my life. All my life. - ha - ha - ha. Right?
Always, always!
Always rode that stupid float together.
Seven points in a row. It ain't logical. It just ain't logical.
It's a wander caper all the way.
It's uninterrupted and it is intensifying.
Always two boys and a girl between the ages of seven and ten, all drowned.
You make a good partner.
Jinxed from the start.
Always been such a good kid.

He was a long - time loser: petty theft, Assaults, drug charges
For being a thoroughly respectful fellow

Has been a political nightmare.
Love will remain a mystery
Always been a stubborn bastard. Now you've finally found a place where the watchdogs can't touch you.

Always have. Maybe it's because they can't ask me for money.
Since the birth of science
Well, it's always today, isn't it?
It was always the chief.
Straight - a student, top of your class?
I have no idea what I'm doing.
It has always been you.
It was you the whole time.
You were all alone in that room
Do you always buy her lunch?
You two have been together ever since.
You guys are the ones who like talking, not me.
From the middle of junior high all the way through high school.
It's been you all along. Who you think you're talking to?
It's always been you and me.
You always are.
This was you the whole time.
You were the one who was always in it for the money!
You were always the one who read the cards.
All the time. But, Kelsey, hi.
You've always stood by me. It's my turn to stand by you.
It was your idea
You have always treasured it
You're the one who's in my hotel.
I thought giving out this award was your thing.
You always have been, and you always will be.
You've been doing all the parenting. It's my turn.
It's always been your place, both of yours.

And for all that time,
Is it always like this?
They always do. Guys find that hot.
Always like that?
It does. It always has and it always will.
Always have. I don't know why.
At this time! I heard.
Always. - I guess he changed things up.
All. All the time? Yeah.
Always? - yeah, always.
It's been like that. Everyone is the same.
That was always the deal.
It's just the way it's always been and it's the way we hope it'll always be.
Has it always been like this? Yes, for the full 20 years.
It's always the same motto: "all or nothing."
Has it always been like that?
They have always run deep within these walls.
Caller did all the talking.
Always in the way.
Looked like that, and worse, all the time.
From being the corner square? Center square.
Has been a wrong turn.
It's all Arsenal, two - nil up and looking like they could go further ahead.
All at minus 300 degrees.
Endless ancestral landscapes.
Always food.
It showed profit.
Keep bucking, y 'all! Keep bucking! And slide!
He keeps reaching for that rope, he's gonna loosen the knot and join his buddy on the pavement.
And you do come to the live shows,
He had this big thing for her.
Where you will work in complete darkness
Always used to imply.
Like a best friend to me, anyway.
There was a voice saying, Jake, don't do this, man.
She's been receiving orchids and love notes from an unknown admirer.
In the back of my mind for everything I've done.
Ever since you wrote that fan letter to Sonny.
There are still technologies even the Goa 'uld seek.
There's a weight pressing down on you all the time.
Had a rage in him,
I've been seeing things.
Something's always cooking.
Always had a thing for Noreen.
There's this one persistent ad BOT.
Has a magnifying glass.
There has always been a prison here, holiness.
If you have a doubt unsolved,
I've been a little busy.
He's always been unbalanced,
Around here lately.
People are always throwing away perfectly good furniture.
My services will always be needed.
Somebody's been stealing his fucking kerosene too.
I've been asking around about you,
We had a little collateral along the way.
S0mething's been manipulating the time lines for ages.
You've had somebody slipping me drugs in Boston. Ls that it?
He was coming in from the cold,
There are people that are tracking him.
I'm sure you get hit on all the time.
Writing for me all my career,
We have people who are still so sceptical
Always someone looking to sell that plot.
It's been kept clean and maintained.
Guy snored the whole time.
People donate shoes and suits all the time.
People have been coming in asking questions.
People die all the time.
You have a staff that dusts your books.
Have you been taking orders? You know the line of command, George.
People been saying they've seen UFOs around.
People have reported seeing the ghost of Madeline o 'Malley.
I'm being followed.
So I've been told.
Someone quick, quick. In and out. - put your hands behind your head.
And people always ask me: "what's it take to be an RSM?"
I keep getting harassed. That's why.
On this stretch of coastline, close to barrow.
There are rumors of secret vaults
It was always believed to be somewhere near Alexandria.
For weeks we've been hearing rumors that CIA is here.
You been taking your showers? Sir, yes, sir!
Does. Present tense.
An anonymous third party has been paying the taxes on it.
We've been hearing comments about originality.
Always. Part of the reason I value you.
Was that always there?
Women keep calling for "Spanky.
Students crash here all the time.
Little people lay in wait to screw you over.
In a really happy mood
I have girls throwing themselves at me all the time,
The sex is constant.
Making strange movements.
There have been reports where astronauts describe something that
It does.
It always worked.
The news just keeps coming in.
In a just and noble verdict.
The whole time, somebody you were close to.
There have been traces of paint and wood stain,
For years rumor has it,
For your mother to take care of anyway.
Always been a little bit intimidated by it.
There always has.
I mean, there's cameras watching the whole time.
I keep getting these weird thoughts and feelings.
About this place.
It's available, and it's very homey.
You keep in touch? No.
There had been warnings that hurricanes would get stronger.
The buildings down.
But there's a lot of corruption going on
To the rumor that I'm only here because
Mild panic attacks for most of her adult life.
It has been said. You don't believe it to be true?
And that keeps happening.
Happens all the time now,
I can't help but have the feeling
I've been having these feelings.
Always. That's good,
Well, not with that attitude we won't.
And I couldn't shake that feeling of it being a Sunday evening.
Staying rich.
And advisors telling me what positions to take.
About not being able to get the sound
Looking at the opening
Just keep walking.
Are you sure we're heading to the sea
Just keep heading straight through. Thanks.
Okay, just keep flying straight ahead North.
Keep going South till you hit the coast.
Just coming in at its face. Oh, shit!
Kept coming at me.
Run straight for that gate! We have to go!
Oh, I was hoping I'd run into you.
Always looking for something better.
Been waiting for you to bust out of here
Expecting you to show up.
I keep expecting to see him in the garden.
Wondered when it would end.
Looks forward to this day and the first victory of Mexico!
Kept hoping one day, pop, he'd be a grown - up.
I couldn't wait for the honeymoon phase to be over.
I was looking forward to going there.
Never married.
For not settling, for biding his time.
I haven't been making out yet
The complete rings from earth.
Just kept going round and around,
Always helped come harvest.
Yes we started that way.
You kept coming over?
I felt so powerless this whole time, but this.
They kept fucking with me.
Consecutive. Paid ahead.
It's that same guy who's been coming. You seen him before?
A little bit all my life, but it's been out of control the last three years.
Have never been heard of since.
Went all the way back to 1938.
Right out of college.
Dreaming of being a vet.
You've wanted to go horseback riding your entire life, and you've never done it?
Dreamed about becoming a movie star.
I dreamed I was one of them.
Always wanted to perform it on "American idol.
Dreamed about one day becoming singing stars.
I've dreamed of being an in person,
Of a place like this
I had dreams that I could walk.
It extends across the block. - how many exits?
Has been wreaking havoc in the center of a cluster of galaxies.
All those lies?
By lying to me for all these years.
 singing and singing
Are lying in heaps of charred wreckage on the beaches of Dunkirk?
As we expanded, as we'd have to.
A lioness is following them,
 we're rejected all the time
Better than you ever were.
Bowing and scraping
Always. Forever. Boss player.
Been begging his parents for a long time to let him walk the dog by himself.
And out of the goodness of your heart, you agreed, even though it might derail your career.
He kept trying to convince me to let him in.
Just keep begging the boss.
Going down, complete darkness
Ever since that thing with Helena.
Buried in a computer all day.
Remains dormant.
It sleeps.
The lack of golden tickets only added to the pressure on
No - one's touched his things since then
No one was ever quite big enough until.
It was never claimed.
But up until this week, his trail was cold.
She never recovered from a traumatic childbirth about 8 years ago.
Um, still haven't heard from you. I need to make sure
I haven't heard from you so I was wondering how you're getting on?
I haven't heard from you since my
And we have ever since,
Never came up. When's yours?
Never showed up, and my landlord hates me.
Never went.
Never got to go.
Not until this morning.
That has not happened.
It always has.
They've been keeping from their friends.
I'm surprised I haven't heard of your outfit.
Been putting off telling you,
I never told you guys about.
A secret from you, and I feel horrible about it.
Nothing ever does.
Never returned.
And he never came back.
Never came back?
And he's away from home, his support system.
And I spent the night there
It took us a long time to narrow it down, but there is no doubt.
Unsuccessfully. And frankly, I'm relieved.
You never found the guy who did it, did you?
I never did.
Never found it, didn't want any help,
And there's nobody else in the bullpen.
Her body was never found.
I never found the body.
I haven't gotten a chance to tell you, but I was so happy you're okay.
Never got a chance to say thanks. You saved my butt on the cargo ship.
Never caught the killer, right?
Not one of the white boys being found dead.
Never caught the driver of the car,
For three days straight.
We never made an ID.
Well, I hadn't heard back from you. I was starting to get worried you got, uh,
Never gave up. It's okay. It's okay.
Kept him sucking.
Never seem to have the time.
Never got around to tossing it.
Never acquires.
Was never found.
Nobody has lived there ever since?
He's unlucky there, too.
He never reacted and so we assumed that he wasn't
He wasn't, he wasn't, and one day he was.
Still no news, but you've taught me never to give up hope.
Do you have any idea how long I had nightmares about being eaten by a whale?
They haven't stopped, have they? No.
Never showed up.
Never played again.
The moment has not arisen.
Ever no, never.
They've been hiding from us.
Hasn't come home since.
Hasn't come back to the office and is out there with him.
Has not been answering my pages,
And you've had no word of her?
This whole have no kids thing
I didn't get your RSVP.
Not realizing that we're a part of it
It was never found.
They never found his body.
They never found his body.
Never found the doer.
The fack that I never found a body didn't surprise me.
Why you haven't been able to find the Pissarro.
Nothing ever did till now.
Never caught 'em?
Never caught the guy. Well, that's why I want you
Never properly set.
Never happened.
I let it hang on and
But nothing seemed to work - apparently until now
Things haven't been working out.
Really haven't been able to connect with anybody.
I haven't had the pleasure.
L didn't have the chance to be seen by you.
And I didn't get the chance.
See you, or
There's been a democracy deficit.
It's never really healed.
Hiding any sign that he intimidates you.
Never been recovered.
And leave it at that.
And still I have not been informed of these networks.
Nothing at all. /// thank you.
No car's came by.
We couldn't nail him.
haven't got around to it.
Never got the chance... Aah!
Just haven't had a chance to turn them in yet. Yeah, right.
Never had the chance to fight for them.
To tell him, without his lessons,
Never got the chance to tell her.
Never really had a chance to talk.
Uh, we... We didn't get a chance to finish talking the other day.
I never got to say, uh,
haven't had a chance to say I'm glad you came back.
I never really got to thank you for, uh,
I never got a chance to tell you, I'm deeply sorry about your wife.
I still haven't had a chance to talk to my dad.
didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
We really didn't get a chance to talk after what happened yesterday.
Since the night of the murders. - Tony rush.
Up to the handle?
Never found who did it.
I was beginning to think you'd lost my number.
White wine, never really seen the point of it.
I could not see him.
Never really had that growing up.
You haven't slept?
And I'm not sleeping well.
haven't gotten any sleep.
But we've always been missing him, so here they are, yummy stuff.
Never left your seat.
didn't leave at all? No.
Never had a chance to go.
Never did get around to changing your name, did you?
And never got around to paying the guy.
Never been married, happy as a clam.
The suspense is just killing me. What's the surprise?
Been out of touch.
I never told her.
I could never get him to break it.
Then you haven't married anyone and you'd say
That was never recovered.
They never found them.
haven't seen you since the... Formal.
I haven't seen him.
No dad in the picture for some time.
I have never lived with my dad!
It never came down.
Have been breaking the first 2 rules of fight club.
Practicing with you, but we have plenty of time.
Began and ended at Hadrian's wall.
It runs right down to the water.
Keep going in that direction.
What? Just carry on down the road?
This young man who's had his eye on you
From the fact that you're driving my car pretty recklessly.
I drown myself in that sanitizer stuff,
See me.
He who has watched her will then appear
And we kept looking at the river.
All the way down the elbows, the whole deal.
And ever!
Living until the present.
Who survives until the present time.
Living with the guilt of what he did.
Use yourself up living on memories.
You will always live in fear.
I have been riding in the shadows of the reputation of the famous double board certified redhead.
To live a complete lie.
So long as you live in the past, you'll never find your future.
He has been.
All this time under the conditions that he's been living
It's really out of date, you know.
Which is used till today
Heading out into that direction.
Tunneling straight down through the Greenland ice
Down these stairs to the cellar
- breaks East - west. - what house is to get it first?
Never regained a pulse.
Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin
Way beyond my lip line, so I wouldn't want 'em anyhow.
Entering into the cranial cavity.
Down to the bone in his extremities.
Just keep breathing,
Keep breathing.
Keep breathing. There you go.
Are still buried deep right here!
I've always loved her.
I always have. Always will.
And you kept on loving her.
I slept right through to the following afternoon.
I always knew after all these years
And swing it from Virginia
Yes, drown the sky
Is it drown the sky?
It percolates down into the mountain, and then collects down under the hills.
And looking to go straight,
And he got that kick - ass stereo he wanted.
Very anxious to meet you again.
All the way through to the island.
Yeah, keep swimming to the other side.
And out into the open sea.
So swim until you can't see land
Got to swim all the way out, retrieve the key, and get back.
All the way up.
The man would not shut up!
Roll like a log till you can't no more
To your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it,
To the creek bed here.
By the time he hit 'm' street, he broke his neck.
Dripped down onto the carpet.
Like a tick.
The real reason of her cousin staying away.
Uh, through 14.
Packing 'em in till the small hours.
Of condoning tyrannical governments.
Have been living as sleepers in American and British cities.
An unlimited potential for Post-historic man.
Fire in the hole.
To rot until the next millennium.
Drunk and incoherent?
It burnt for three days straight.
As long as you keep the light on its eyes, it won't submerge.
Keep the beam on the compass.
Everything you're doing for him.
Always looked out for his baby sister, comes home every month to help us look for her.
Looking after his family,
And comfort him until an ambulance arrives.
Until he's all grown up.
To look after you.
School today and have her till morning?
Provided for me, loved me, I believe,
Taking care of her?
It burns and burns
All the way up the flagpole?
And I always will.
Always loving you, always saying yes.
They've been hot and heavy ever since.
And he always had.
Loving me until you die?
I always have and always will.
I always loved him.
Loves his family.
And I always will. But I never tried to woo her for myself.
That he loves us.
Oh, continue to love me. Never misjudge.
And it ended up here on my chest.
The muscle ended up in your chest? Right. Ended up here.
A special rescue squad
At the craps table, and we wanted to reward you.
Who keeps yelling from the balcony.
And keep on biting so hard, till I'd bleed sometimes.
Giving enough blood to put the red cross out of business.
And playing and playing and playing.
And still play a poker game that our daddies' daddies started 50 years ago?
Play along, make believe that this does not piss me off.
We won't be back before it's Christmas day
And we played till dark.
We won't be back before it's new year's day
Until somebody loses a testicle!
Where people don't leave till the next day.
Rode him to level four.
When the neighbors called the cops on us.
At a card game until dawn.
You handle him too much, he's not gonna last.
Always took good care of him.
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard to stay angry
Holding on to anger just eats you up inside.
Living in a funeral home all your life - maybe things got mixed up, huh?
We have always lived here.
Growing all the way to the tops of the peaks.
Lasted until Jubal died.
Which I still use to this day.
Keep the pressure keep the pressure... On the trigger.
Keep pushing! Okay, I see its head.
The last couple of days.
With the old English thing, OK?
During the revolutionary war days.
Just smacking that flint over and over again with a machete, and nothing.
Always using an I. S. I.
Scrubbing them with a Brillo pad.
He was licking me with his eye the whole time.
Bang their head against the problem
He had his knee on my head the whole time.
Use to make my own arrows!
Always on his own passport.
Always in the past tense
Keep taking it in through the nose,
And constantly tormenting yourself with the latest tornado updates is not gonna get us there any faster.
You're welcome, by the way.
Making all the decisions for you,
And you left it on until his heart burst.
Drawing Smurfs until ninth grade.
Till tomorrow.
You have until third moon.
Just to go live in a convent.
Just been fucking with my mind, you know?
I haven't been the best at sticking around,
In some kind of bubble to protect them but I know we can't.
And remain there until I bring you word.
It'll stay there, until... Until it's rescued.
The past few months?
It's been kept.
Kept it all this time?
Always. They're noted in the files and sent to legal.
I was saving it.
I'm totally paranoid all the time.
Till, like, 8:00 a. M.
Is that she was sick my entire childhood until she died,
Yeah, it's moving down into my back.
That goes from here to the back of my neck.
I have to live like this.
To use their business as camouflage.
Always. Your your mom is visiting from new York.
Still, I honestly believe, if she was looking down on us now.
Wondered about.
All the frowning and the one - word answers.
Watching us all the time?
Watching us the whole time to see what's going on.
It's always been there, but it started to get worse
Just now has been watching me pee pee, really.
Do not let him out of your sight.
He's staring at you.
Cow eyes the whole time. Guys, seat goes right here.
The one that's been staring at you.
I'm sorry if you bother, but your face look familiar sir.
Watching her and coming into her house in the middle of the night.
He just - he just stared at me.
My boss at the show
Looking at me
Stare at it until it disappears?
Keep looking at it
Staring at that word, "unless
Spent a lot of hours looking at that, wanting more.
Kept gazing at doors for you to come back.
Oh, being unable to see.
always... And never.
Always... And never.
When your voice and mine become one and whole.
 always believe in...
Go on believing that her daughter ran away
 that there would be another chance
Always believe in love
Continue to trust your heart, and your dreams will follow.
Without incident.
Stay in love.
Wanted to see you dead.
All the time waiting for your pal, Jesus, to save her.
Keep looking at him. If you had any heart at all, you'd be stealing for a living.
She's been watching you on TV.
I've been seeing things again.
Down into the heart?
Watching TV all day, we're taking him out of here.
He made me watch!
Never leaving his eyes. Never leaving his eyes.
That keep looking at you.
Just keep your eye on the horizon. I'll get you some ginger ale.
Keep Looking towards the sky, the secret to it is to keep away from hate.
I kept watching, wishing for the rain to stop
I kept staring at the sky... It became darker and darker
Watching her scratch her ear.
All the time. And you are just the crab to do it.
Just keep looking at it. don't stop looking!
And I watched till it burned black.
Keep looking in his eyes!
And look at me all the time
don't stop looking at me.
Through the hidden cameras all the time.
Looking straight at us. Hmm, not sure it likes us.
Keep looking at me. Alright?
Was always looking my way, but never came over.
Keep looking at me. Keep looking at me.
Actually from the pitchers hand all the way in to the catchers glove.
You follow the ball right into here. You see that? Okay?
You know, looking out at the audience. That's a
Watching the kids, and, well, it is a school.
He's exhausted from reading that bill. I got woozy from just carrying it.
He kept watching the clock.
Reading stories about bad people he believed deserve to die.
When I was a little boy.
Constantly? Really?
Fortune didn't smile upon them.
I keep glancing over.
Keep your eyes open.
Keep your eye open. Keep your eye open, Steve - o!
For 14 hours straight.
Sleep till I can sleep no more. And then
I haven't been sleeping so well.
I slept till about 11:00 or so.
Till you turn 18?
Sleep till morning light.
That you're sleeping till now? Shut up and get out.
Waiting for your turn.
Keeps sleeping?
Until she goes to the store.
Keeps it a secret until.
What isn't he telling us?
Way before she let me in. All right.
You knew!
The whole time? No. Not the whole time.
It was always gonna end this way.
Always knew you would. Right? didn't I always say that?
I always knew you were lazy, but I didn't realize
I feel heat.
I knew something was wrong with me.
Working on the same thing over and over until they get it right.
Scientists have been drawn to one of the greatest mysteries
Just bang, bang, bang up his ass.
Hard enough to draw blood.
Always getting in the way.
Praying to God the whole time,
Far from your side.
Until it was stolen from him late in his career.
Always wearing the same clothes
Always dresses nice.
It's always the shoes.
And wearing all the time
All the way across the sea.
Right through to the research farm behind me.
All the way past molasses swamp and I win.
Breathing down your neck the whole time.
All the way up by your head and I won't look at anything
That you'll stand by me forever
The way you stood up for me
Standing by me. I know it Hasn't been easy.
Right up front in the front line of defense against Tai lung up front.

Of standing around the sidelines like this, you know?
To defend himself to the end.
He just stood there, staring.
Standing,
Standing by and waiting at your back door
Has been doing whatever it takes
Has been doing whatever it takes to keep the river thriving.
When she was conscious.
Kept laughing saying nothing. Your tooth are extremely clean.
For the rest of your days here on earth？
Giggle till it hurts
A smile every now and then wouldn't kill you.
Waiting, waiting.
And waiting.
And I waited, and he never come home.
 be so alone
For as long as I can.
Until you came home too loaded to go to his banquet.
Wait for the fire to die. Take him. He'll lead you to the northern lights.
Wait till they do, indeed.
Until he goes away to college.
Wait till he finds what I left in his birdbath.
Until him and his boys get up here.
Wait until he is in full back swing with the wood
I wait until he has a break, some kind of break in his schedule.
And waiting until you was 1 8 so that l could see you.
Just wait till you get home?
When you finally came in.

Until you knew that you belonged with us.

Wait till you see what I can do with the fog.
Wait until, uh.

Wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
Until the person goes away?
Waiting until Andy was ready to be a father.
And wait till it's empty.
Wait until it's empty then get the papers proving who I am.
Let's wait till we get back, then we'll tell everything to the MPs.
The road ended when my husband passed away.

Till my case is unsolvable? - you got a girl that's dead.
Until my eyes were adjusted to the dark.
won't be so steady come morning.
And not return there till spring.
He waited for his kill shot.
Times it to the last second.
Waiting until the body is discovered
Wait till somebody comes out.
Laid low till the cleaning crew left, then had.
To wait until just before the dustmen arrive.
Waited until it was dark.
Wait till they see us.
They will wait for their one true love.
We kept waiting until 4pm the next day
Until this boat is at sea?
 wait till the warm - up's underway
Waiting for this hell to be over.
Or wait until the anger passes？
 wait till you see that sunshiny day
Waiting for the day that the prophecy might be fulfilled,
I waited for the diner to empty.
And hanging around for awhile and then popping out,
I'll wait.
 I will be waiting
Keeps waiting for publishers to reply.
And I'll wait long enough
Who's been waiting for a big break all his life.
Waiting on parents that will never come back.
You've been waiting for this.
Waiting for the day when you will help bring an end to the tyranny of the gods.
So that one day I could place this call.
And just waiting till I was 18,
Just waiting for a chance to use.
Laid low till the cleaning crew left.
It's been waiting for him.
Always waiting for you.
Always waiting for you, Toyoji, and you never come.

And waited until such a time as he did spot her heading for the laundromat.
Yeah, prior to the arrival of the mother ship,
Been waiting for the day
And waited. That was a year ago?
Waiting until you were old enough to get on the show.
Kept waiting for it to get harder, but
And proceed to steal historical relics until you're caught, right?
keeping score.
To take your side.
At April's Halloween party.
Always, man.
Right on his heels.
And repopulate the bald eagle species,
This constant obsession with needing to know
And they never stop.
Who won't leave you alone?
Over analyze whether it was makeup sex or congratulations sex.
All this time, it's been right here in front of me.
Ah, till I'm hitting 85%.
Practicing until sunset?
Every single moment till the match. - all right. All right.
wheelchair - bound Yoo - Yeon, who has no feelings in her legs,
He stayed in orbit around the moon and never landed.
Who's been feeding them rat casserole
Is keep feeding him pain killers,
Who has to keep giving him all the bad news.
His conspiracy theory
I even give you some rice, and you still complain!
I've been calling you.
The psycho who was making obscene calls?
And I have been cleaning up your messes and doing your care taking for fucking ever,
The one who keeps showing you pictures of her grandchildren?
Who's the man who always brings you flowers?
Who's been surprising everybody,
Kept bringing her meat.
Kept on sending her weird, freaky food - fixated messages.
If you keep buying your kids crap like this,
Pumped up the word until it exploded
Two things that always give us great joy.
Wrote all the time.
Been calling my office, looking to shake me down.
Keep recording me?
That keeps calling my publicist.
Glue your eyeballs to them till I get there.
Glue your eyeballs to them till I get there.
And it keeps going on.
From time to time.
For generations to come.
Since its formation.
Stretching far across the slopes of Mount perdition.
Keep blossoming until it shows its entire glory and beauty.
That's haunting her right now, don't you think?
Insists on bugging me about the tab for today.
That haunts me to this day.
Always on you.
That haunts you and drives you.
I keep having them, and they're terrible.
I've been protecting you.
don't l always have your back?
Stay gorgeous.
All the way to the back, the end of revelations,
Taking out the files - studying them over and over
When you're in protective custody the whole time.
To stop thinking about it.
Keep cracking wise, pal. It's a good way to make friends.
I've been patiently waiting here.
The river's oyster beds for the last four years.
My ears are ringing.
They talk all the time.
Till 2:00 in the morning.
Talked all the way till they closed the place.
And we just talked and talked.
Chatting away like they were old pals.
Oh, you've been out of the loop, so I can't expect you to know this,
I mean, without any of us knowing... Doing this the whole time?
She had a string of bad debts.
Straight down 10, maybe 15 feet.
Down, down over her knees.
I've been kept occupied. - so I hear.
He carries that with him.
Keep asking myself, did I push him too far,
To getting American companies to help combat this.
Worked to make this peace agreement a reality.
Been working for many years on how to design replacement parts
A couple of days, we came to an island,
And sail to San Francisco
You know, one that sticks with you, doesn't let you rest?
In search of a home
I'll stay open.
But known thee with all of my heart.
Enjoying your time riding my behind?
Up into the hills and even into the mountains around Zurich,
In your basement the whole time.
Being stuck in your own psyche.
Used to hide in it all the time.
Hung onto it.
The whole way? Yeah, the whole way.
In some damn vent, agent Pierce.
She's always tired, ain't that right, baby?
He's been keeping a low profile since.
Has been much attached to the mobs.
Where he's apparently been living quietly until tonight.
Keep acting like something you want is gonna happen
To be slipping.
With the ghost of your disappointment
Have always been very well protected
Kept down by the man.
I've been a freak.
His mother control him so much he acts like a servant.
He was obsessed with his old farmhouse.
That has always known
You're always pretending is your boyfriend?
In the penitentiary. Cuff him.
Below decks in the ship's brig.
And badgered at every turn.
Were kept under control.
Something primal.
I was stuck inside for so long... Right?
Underestimated by kings and leaders.
Such a long time in such a mess
Unit 7, which has been unjustly attacked by the media,
And happy and loved.
Who has been held up to you.
Being released from stars,  including our sun.
Losers, who get beaten down all the time.
Who is constantly being turned down for a date.
Was cuffed up the whole time.
Was always taught
And then bored and finally, bored again
aren't you tired of swimming in gossip girl's fishbowl?
It's used as an insecticide,
It has long been known to relieve pain, such as that in your leg,
Have been repressed and controlled by men.
Kept getting distracted by the boys.
I've always been stared at. I want to walk.
A constant symbol of the plains
Who has been detained at
Entrance and exit into some kind of sky world.
Has always been sacrosanct.
It was formerly believed
Had always been considered to be a tall tale.
Long considered a Jane Doe,
Has been described as the most wired country in Europe.
Was considered off of the beaten track of standard science.
Caves, long dismissed as dark and lifeless deserts,
And has always been blamed for Australia's draughts.
Who had been called into question in this University
Just being around this all the time.
It's just been weighing on me a bit.
And it's shaped by wind, it's shaped by waves.
Been haunted by it ever since.
Fake it till you make it.
Then pretending our "friends" will be back from the "bathroom" soon
It takes a lot out of you - acting all the time.
It hurt to hold a smile.
It's when it creeps into its third century
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Until passing through the event horizon
Just hold out until I've completely finished.
Still be herein the morning.
You keep trying to bring him down.
Is pulling me away.
It would be hours and hours of interrogation
How you manage to still ruin my life.
Since we moved in together, and you refused.
Asking for more conflict in the series.
Demanding we release him. What's happened out there?
Until I go away from London, it's not safe for you to go out.
Got drug tested all the time. If I smoked weed, I'd be off the team.
Across its toes to its tail.
Keep seeing her face and how hard it's gonna be.
Biding his time,
Observe her until then.
They had been watching the battle and
I'm minding my own business, okay?
Have been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
I've been insecure and... Dishonest.
I've been having diarrhea.
I've often felt like an outsider - never really fitting in,
I always knew you'd be a beauty.
Always felt that you were fully repressed living
Insisted I was cheating on him with anyone,
Who said I could do it all alone
Have been feeling very insecure.
Thinks anyone who talks like this must have ganja to sell.
Was always a temporary assignment.
Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting.
All your warnings about me sleeping with my boss,
And I've been planning on coming here. But.
One of the 2 American spaceships
One of the 2 American spaceships believed until now to have disintegrated in orbit,
Always knew that the princess' soul would return,
Kept thinking, I could never live without you by my side
Have always regarded the British people as completely horrible.
All my life. He's my brother.
Never liked us.
That never fails to amaze the world.
To inspire and provoke twenty - four centuries later.
What's the point in keeping him here like that after all this time?
You've been leaning on your whole life.
Makes you think, doesn't it?
I'm sorry we keep asking you to treat us.
Developing my skills as a people person.
Suspend her until she gets serious about this.
You had us all so worried.
And I haven't stopped since.
Hanging up on us.
Being at home with Anthony,
Asking me to do - draw a map.
Where you keep me doing things for you, hoping I'll slip up?
Breathing exercises all the way to school.
Keeps me working.
To let me keep doing that, I'm going to be okay.
He kept asking me to marry him, but I said.
it's - it' s - it's - it's haunted me.
To keep me high the whole time.
It spiraled and.
With the sort of physical contact
Can't get them out of my mind
What has always fascinated me most
keeping me alive, eh?
You kept me talking.
Messed me up real good, man.
And it's a point of honor with me.
To get this fire going
And kept training and kept it up, right?
Right up till the day before the launch.
I did my training, I deserve.
But always remember,
Always remember I am nothing.
Always remember I am fear.
Always remember I am filth.
Always remember I am hunter.
Remembered her all this time.
Keeps going on about hell and purgatory.
Hasn't shown any improvement
Keep trying till I get their attention.
Try to surprise him, and he would always, always, always say.
I've been trying to bury.
In an attempt to conquer the holy land;
To kill the peace treaty from the start.
Always probing.
Am trying to come to terms with my guilt, because
Kept saying how everything stank.
Gabbing all the time, won't let nobody get a word in edgewise.
I shop for bathing suits I never buy.
Talking a whole bunch of shit
Just kept saying he killed her. How? How did he kill her?
Talking all big about his ship coming in.
Always telling us how much he loved us.
Kept claiming his dentist killed him.
Been talking about how he's gonna smoke the bitch.
They were just like, "you did so good.
All the way to long Island.
Kept hearing about this headstone. Wanted to see it for ourselves.
And the expiration date on shit like that is fight night.
She keeps talking about you until late at night.
Keep repeating that. You feel threatened.
They said that?
Keep talking, keep talking, keep talking. Stay focused.
He just kept going and talking and talking.
All that time, mostly saying, "he'll be back.
He kept saying she was the one.
How long have we been saying we were going to.
Kept saying he loved her.
He kept saying "matzah taco.
But enough of me. What about you?
You kept saying, "I want to come home, mom.
They tell me! That I'm seeing things.
Also claims that they were alone all night, claims that he doesn't own a gun,
He just keeps saying, "please.
Kept saying: one year and I'm outta here, one year.
For the past four days?
And you, go on and on and on about grieving relatives,
Going on about being followed, people trying to kill him. Crazy stuff.
That they were gonna help me,
Says he's my boyfriend.
He kept saying he would destroy us.
He kept talking about trading places with you.
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.
The one who keeps talking is yen Zizhun
Be talking about him.
Always talking about you. - really?
Been reading your books, I have a positive attitude.
Working leads that went nowhere.
Went all the way back to 1995
Went all the way back to 1995 and there's really nothing there.
No, talking about it just makes it harder, so
We talked until after 11:00.
She's talking about half the time anyway.
Talking about God and forgiveness, all kinds of crazy shit.
Charge to bring him news of you,
Has been running an investigation?
Blaming me this whole year? Is because.
Blamed herself for not acting sooner.
And don't stop till you get to the end of the block.
And your non-stop gambling!
And we don't stop until one of us has it all.
We play till we drop. Winner takes all.
Just talk about his big cock.
All the way to the championship!
Down that hall, fifty meters, turn left.
Keep coming, keep coming.
And keep going, going, going,
Keep moving, keep moving.
Straight ahead, straight ahead.
Keep coming, keep coming, keep coming.
Three blocks down and around the corner.
Go down street.
And walk straight down
It's just down there to the left.
Down that road, I can say with confidence really that there is a
Keep walking, darling. She's cute.
Just keep going. - yeah, I don't know.
Just keep going. Yeah, I don't know.
Keep walking and don't turn around till you count to fifty.
Just keep moving. He's walking to the car.
Keep on straight and you'll find a three - way street.
Just keep g0ing. y0u're OK. Y0u're safe.
Walk straight! You fucking birdbrain!
Straight ahead, sir. Go ahead. Right over there.
Keep going. Move. Go!
Just keep walking. don't look back.
Keep walking. Ignore them.
Just keep going to the end of the world.
Keep to the main square, now.
All the way to where they found us.
Please keep walking, until you cannot hear this announcement.
Walk until you hear the bee hive.
And you keep going all the way back.
Keep walking until you're on the other side of the fountain.
And you follow it down until you hit a grove of trees on your right.
And we went as far as the end of the city.
Straight down the hall.
Down that hall to the left.
It's all the way at the top.
Down at the end of the hall.
All the way to the end, and up the hatch.
As far as Williams town?
Go all the way to be sure.
Makes it all the way down to the other dude's side.
It will take you to a hiking trail that leads directly to the bridge.
Keep going, it's at the end.
Keep going to the roof.
It's Bryant park all the way.
Continue to the end. Your target's North.
All the way down and to the left!
To just barely where - where I could stand, and
And he walks me right up to the door,
Continue to the end, your target's to the North.
So sometime.
Continue on to the staircase.
don't stop till you reach the fields!
All the way down the street.
Straight to the stalls. Stop for nothing. See you later.
Keep going straight down the hallway.
All the way here?
To the dirt path which has not got any name on it.
Walked to the end of the bar,
The countdown to that doorbell ringing,
Just keep walking to the center of the cafe.
Keep going till you find my friend.
Keep it moving, people.
Down the corridor.
Keep walking, pecker-wood.
Keep moving.In the back.
You go straight, you turn left at Buckingham 311.
It's over there, on the corner.
Straight. About fifteen minutes.
Keep straight on. Give my regards to the earth's core.
You just keep walking, all right?
Just keep going. Okay.
Uh, straight through here. Right. Just to the left here.
There are no turns, so you can't get lost. Just keep walking.
That it was a straight shot.
Just keep moving. And don't make any decisions any watcher can track.
Just go straight this way.
You won't miss it
Just keep going.
Let's just walk. - all right.
Let's just walk.all right
Let's just walk. All right.
Keep it coming, very good, down a step,
Keep moving, it will stop in a second.
Keep going! Run!
Go straight. We have to go to the embassy.
It's straight ahead. I saw the sign.
Straight through. Rock 'n' roll!
Straight? Yes. - thanks.
You can't stand still.
Keep moving. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Keep going and come back here.
Walking... And now I'm here... In this room.
Go straight and left.
Start walking... Now, please.
Walk until your feet bleed. And then keep walking.
Walk up to the first Homo you see
You go till you see a house.
Keep going, till we make some kind of contact.
OK. Keep it going. Keep 'em closed.
Just keep walking until you start to loosen up.
Straight on, second on the right.
And floor it. I'll tell you where to turn.
Straight on. Thanks. Let's go.
Down the hall, through the door, make a right.
And keep them moving till you're out of fort Harmon country!
More and more quickly with time.
Down, down, down.
Gotta keep running!
All the way! All the way!
Keep going! Keep going, Ryan! don't stop!
Just keep running, get help!
You keep going to the next base. If you get to enough bases you score a run.
Keep on running. don't look back.
Run and do not look back
Until his nipples bleed.
Keep running until you're not hungry.
I end up on the wrong side of this fence.
don't stop till you get to the anomaly.
didn't stop until I reached Greece. Then I ran for sport.
Running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face.
All the way to that pastry shop I hate.
Up to the van where his target sat with four children in the back.
Keep going to the roof. Now. don't stop for anything. Keep going.
don't stop till you reach the river.
Ran across the road, almost got hit by that guy in the car.
Head straight for the saddle shop
Keep moving! To your left! To your left!
Keep going. Come on.
He ran around until he passed out.
And you don't stop until you reach the town.
I ran until my muscles burned
Run... 'till... Drop... Yes.
All the way to the line, coach.
Kept running into them in the high stakes games.
We keep him talking.
Keep talking to him; keep talking.
Has been synonymous with the words "physical education".
To be with you all the time.
That followed you home from jogging.
Having spoken, the doomsayer departs.
Has been text - messaging people,
Have been telling people that he wasn't a good worker
He followed her to the park.
Thirteen years of sex with the same man can be a little bit boring, all right?
Has been following me around,
Are telling girls that they have to be thinner.
And we've spent our lives together
To keep booking appointments.
And kept on telling me all the reasons why we should hire her and
You keep telling me I have to grow up,
Keeps telling me to make things you like.
With him all the time.
All the way to Kathy Griffin doing stand - up.
All the time, so maybe you go for the easier target.
Just follows his heart wherever it leads him.
Keep after him until he's so jealous he can't stand it.
Or am I just gonna follow you around?
He wouldn't leave her alone.
Came after me.
Just stay with me. In a half - hour, it's done.
All... The way... Out.
Kept coming up behind me and smelling my hair.
To continue following them up there.
Keep track or care any more.
The one who's been tailing us.
Follow it all the way through.
Following in your shoes.
That follows me around.
Moving it across.
Across the whole universe.
To about midnight, and we get, like, an hour break for lunch.
Gotta dance till your diva is through
Keep it moving, please don't stop don't stop
You were bouncing.
to keep dancing wherever we go next ,wherever we go next
He had this girl knocked out at his feet.
And I kept kicking him until he was dead.
Tap your way all the way.
You just stomp it.
Keep on hopping, buddy.
don't get a hell of a lot of use.
It does the inside cupboards no good at all.
Behind the monitor forever.
And sticking to their blind spots.
I've been hiding in my garage.
Due to unresolved childhood issues.
Stay hidden until I come back.
Of hiding out these days.
And had eluded authorities for that long.
That must have eluded Alex.
And running from cursed creatures?!
Six weeks towards the end, but it was worth it.
She kept lying on the tatami mat
Contemplating the difficult nature of his new existence.
I'm bored. All I do is lay around.
Just spin and spin.
Around the top and come back on the bottom.
And don't stop spinning until you're dizzy
It just keeps going right to voice mail.
And round. Whoa.
Keeps changing accounts, deleted her avatar's history.
And moved through his nervous system, hands, bowels, muscles.
Has argued the case
Has always defended the theory
Has always defended the theory.
It's way down there though.
All the way across the bridge.
At least until you remember when your real birthday is.
All the way to the wall!
Pretty much live my life
Keep coming.
Over to the northwest quadrant, all right? Good.
All the way down the lane and then go up for a left - handed layup.
The whole time that H. J. 's been gone,
To run statistical probability scenarios
Stayed friends.
Had an unsettled concern.
He kept chipping away at it,
Keep pushing, we'll get a whiff of the money, too.
Oh, all this sneaking around is driving me crazy.
Isn't she, though?
To continue for a couple of hours.
Driving mile after mile after.
Always. Why? I thought that we could get a drink and catch up.
Be pounding on your leg the whole time,
And keeping him here, it's only making it harder on everyone.
And it goes on and on and on.
So the reasoning continues backwards.
As loyal as ever? Yes, sir.
It's rude to stare, you know.
doesn't it hurt, smiling like that all the time?
Just all the time.
All the time. - mm.
That was the plan. - you were flying the plane. How could you have killed him?
For all these years.
I'm tired from all this walking.
Just keep saying it over and over again until it sticks.
Just keep telling me that.
Always did.
He always did,
In making the arrangement permanent.
Like, forever?
And live with this. It may not be "the" justice, but it's "some" justice.
Keep trying to breathe for you.
Always, man. Always.
all day, but I can't.
For them, you know. Yesterday that one was in my underwear drawer.
For hundreds of thousands of years.
Always, sir.
Is it always that way?
Is it always like this? I wouldn't know.
Permanent.
And it'll go on 'til the end of time.
Again quickly.
All the time. - all the time
I can't afford to keep it, either.
All the time. I stole it from her.
All this jumping and fighting.
You know, all the time. I'm sorry, but I wasn't raised that way.
This constant pushing is not helping your cause.
It's not OK to keep doing like this
Always. There was an empty tape box. Then there's obviously another tape.
Keep feeding me like that, I'll lose my girlish figure.
Keep it up, pretty soon it's not gonna hurt at all.
Right up until the day of the election.
It's amazing that I'm lasting through it.
Waiting around is making me crazy.
Is it always low?
Practice with these.
it goes on and on and on and on
Always do, boss.
Being so naked the whole time, you've got used to your bodies.
To keep whining like that. Oh, you gonna get us there solo?
Anymore. This guy... Animal.
It's happening all the time.
Always. Always snorting. I'm not kidding.
Always. Always snorting. I'm not kidding.
Goes all the way up into the sky, then falls all the way back down on to me.
In and out of Europe all the time.
Straight in?
And it keeps on going all the way up to make iron.
However, kept struggling fiercely to restore their country.
Before they know what hit them.
To pervert and betray the truth at all times...,
He breaks the rules all the time.
And feed them down to the basement.
Runs up to the surface, which is attached to a bell on top of the ground.
Who are always lost.
Wondering how they got here?
Chasing you all the way to... Where the hell are we?
Into an apartment complex.
All the way to Santa Monica, then they lost it.
Followed them under the monorail,
For over a year now.
Going after her all the way that way.
And went in right after him.
Follow this story right to the end.
The camera guy that was following him
To the root of all evil - me.
And kept pursuing them, waiting for them to slip up.
Always chasing a faster time. Not me.
Of what it is that you're going for.
Back to the dark ages.
Up until four months before I was born.
Dating back to my first pediatrician.
Back to the source.
I would chase it until I couldn't chase it anymore.
Chasing after madam and young master
Chases the demon and the girl.
What do you mean you don't stop?
Back to his father's office.
Chasing after that first plane.
Asking about me.
To walk in his footsteps.
Where you go, I go.
and retreated back to its predecessor.
And see out the semester.
Chair and all, down to precinct headquarters.
As far as the train station, anyway.
All the way to the door?
If you can keep those coming all night. Thank you.
Being on the road, on the run.
And far be it from anyone
I'm still running, and I thought
It's no good to keep running away.
I'm sorry I've been avoiding you,
Lots of head winds.
Is never caught certainly even suspected.
Working my way up slowly to the top.
It connects directly to the strong room below.
That runs to the next building.
Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.
That runs up into the base of the mountains here.
all the way to the top of the hill.
All the way to the top of the hill.
On up to San Francisco,
It'll take you as far as the woods.
Runs around the back of the studios.
Which will go all the way to la Roque.
From it into an area that might otherwise be common open space.
There were bodies on the road into town.
The way up to the attic.
And up into your brain so we can check for clots.
All the way to the sea.
Leading to the top of the building, decorated with statuary.
Making their way to the water heater.
all the way up to the location. See?
It leads all the way.
All the way to the island of Hawaii.
The tunnel drop into a storm drain. Go.
Leading to the garage.
Everything was done over the phone.
And stroll right into town
They kept pushing me to find a cheaper way out.
He kept asking me something.
That's gonna wait forever for you to come home?
Have been plagued by a pack of subterranean hooligans.
You're staying up and talking to me!
I've been fighting this... Stupid cancer,
It's all been great.
Just conviction all the way around that nobody cannot get it.
I was still so angry.
I always will.
Keep doing that, and you might just get through this.
Always like that?
I'm sorry about how I treated you.
Stays like that until morning.
All the time there she is,
Evil down to their black hearts, which pump not blood.
Never liked it.
Never been quite
It Hasn't been easy.
You know, it's been tough.
I didn't get anything until I talked
Kind of ever.
But never had the guts to tell her
won't go away.
Always was.
Never have been. You're years older than he is. We've been get together for months
Never believed it.
Never could figure out how he knew where the fish were.
And always has been.
couldn't talk right for the longest time.
Never. I took this job,
But don't ever move it and then I'll always know where it is.
I never get to come over to your place?
You never said you loved her
They always do.
It's always been my business.
Always good for a couple bucks.
Kept up his life insurance premiums.
They never really stop.
Always Heinrich - Heine street.
It's always too fucking hot.
That mother nature gives us.
Always thought they're nuts for standing on the traffic, but
Spend my entire life thinking I'm one thing
I put her on the pedestal.
Always have in the past.
Does it always feel like last night?
We'll go with you.
Home for good?
It's always gonna be you and me.
It would be daytime all the time.
Is constantly feeling like I have to apologize for it, you know?
That there is nearly always enough good around to be going on with.
She'll always have a warm meal and a roof over her head.
There's always a blue wire. Or a red one.
That's our lasting memory. Yeah.
It follows you around forever.
And always will be.
Does it ever feel that way?
It's gonna be like this all day, baby.
I know, but it's like
Until all that coal is gone.
Same suite.
Lived here my whole life.
You and me always had a good working relationship, and I hope that can continue.
I've been doing this all wrong.
Is it always this dangerous? Yeah.
It's always been like this.
Is it always like this? - nah.
It's always like that. It's happened so often.
There was always gonna be a snooper force policy.
Always ready. Always ready.
As I'll ever be.
As I'll ever be. How about you?
Ready as I'll ever be.
I've been having hallucinations.
I never knew where he was.
We can't touch him. - that's not the point.
Consistently crushing it, I know.
Kept on beating you down,
Been under a lot of pressure. Just let me relax.
It kind of tanked.
Been forever.
Became a moral imperative.
Had been there for all of them.
Kept me coming to my meetings, kept me working my steps.
It just keeps going, "please try again, good - bye.
Would always just be friends,
That stayed here the whole time.
You were never more than just friends, right?
Before we started to feel something more.
It has only ever been you.
don't you get sick of it just being the two of us?
Has it always been?
There always is.
And that's okay, because at night when I go on stage,
I have always listened to you
Working on a riverboat.
Since always. Since I was 3. Hmm.
Always liked his jacket.
I always have. I was a total whore in college.
Behind my back the whole time.
Always is.
It's always raining there. Not like here. It's always raining.
I was downstairs the whole time.
The whole time... - no, no, no,
Who is always there no matter what.
It's always been there, a constant companion.
Works for us.
I keep Bing travel magazines.
They had it all the time.
He's been chasing has been under his nose all along.

Always. Always working, gordo.
Have always traveled across the frozen sea.
One constant word.

Flashing back and forth and back and forth all the time.
It is you who would seek to call the tune!
Always has.
It's always changing.
It was never gone, just on hold.
She was all about crossing inappropriate boundaries.
Telling people that their family members were dead,
Kept babbling on about his mission.
Ever wonder why prisons have such pretty names?
Being there for her and always there.
She's had her the whole time.
Saving tips, quitting up weed, booze, almost everything.
All of it out of my car.
You're screaming.
I been working a lot.
Been thinking about your mom?
Thinking of all the things I wanna say to her.
I think all the time.
It was under our noses the whole time.
Has been here with us this entire time?
She's always here. I know, but is she ''here'' here?
That would go round and round in my head.
It's always a bitch.
Making up excuses all along the way.
Along the way, I smoke. Stop trying to domesticate me.
And it's remained with me forever.
Sues them all the time.
She completely defended me she really put him in his place
Keep taking pills.
I've been dreaming about this.

And have been taking care of our siblings for most our lives.

Always blending in.
All the time, actually. Romeo and Juliet.
Was talking about passion and music and the Torah,
Walked all the way, won't catch me driving.
And you're dancing all the time and you hardly eat.
I kept on turning around in circles.
Oh, has that been there the whole time?
 it was there all the time
They were there all along.
Which are always there and readily available.
You were there at all times.
Have been so out of control.
It was all too easy. We just waItzed on in there like we owned the place.

Always there.
Somehow I knew you were there.
Completely yessed her to death
Always wanted to write greeting cards?
Is particularly unhappy having Ross back in the lineup.
Always ass - kicking.

Always at our best, sir.
All the time? Most of the time.
Been wanting to see how it works.
Ah, always good. Okay.
Has served me quite nicely so far. I wanna thank you for your time.
The way it used to be.
It was fun, I thought
It was great till he took that promotion.
It was great until the very last couple of notes and, you know,
Have been very frightened about opening up this tin
I'm always lucky.
It'd be nice to be happy all the time
Busy all the time.
Happily ever after
Emotion hungry all of the time.
I'm still waiting to meet an ancient race that's invented the car.
You've always been funny.
He's always been incredibly supportive.
It's been rather controversial.
Always dour. Always tragic.
And exhausted all the time.
Always really excellent work.
Care of me.
You've been caring
Always felt in my heart.
And it's been hell.
Wrong in all the right ways, my friend.
It's been nice
As timid as the day is long.
You always were.
It always hurts.It never goes away.
Whole life as dutiful, repressed, unsatisfied.
So it's been good
And always great to see you, big guy.

And do knitting to keep himself busy.

Trying to get yourself off the blacklist and all,
I always wanted to do that.
I've been wanting to talk.

Knowing that your father has done these horrible things.
Every day since.

They keep showing the same thing over and over and over.
Will be the first of many happy anniversaries
All the repeating the ends of the lines?
In different languages, over and over again.

Fire away, chief Holland.
Asking all those questions about my background, my health.
All that asking questions about how you are and how's your day?
Kept asking me why I wanted
Kept asking me why I wanted to join a family with so many secrets.
And he kept asking me if you were ever coming back,
He was always asking me for that black book.
And check with them if we're doing it right.
Kept asking if he could deliver the passports himself. I should have known.
Keeps asking about his dad. Worried school started without him.
Keep asking whoppers like that, we're gonna be here for a while.
All these questions. This is beginning to sound like an interview.
Spending a lot of time in her room.
It went to the supreme court. You know what they told her?
Always smelled like grilled cheese.
His evil spirit keeps following me
I'm the one that should have been there.
With him, as always, his coach and father, sergeant Pete Daytona, of the us Marines.
That kids can be there for their parents.
The one person who's always been at my side.
That will be with us... Always.
At least until someone better comes along.
You know, who stuck by you through all this.
With me!
And she talked to me until the sun came up.
As long as it takes.
And stayed with him.
You kept company with.
Every step of the way. You can't ignore it.
In a way her parents couldn't be.
I'm playing with Sayuri
Came with me just to keep me company.
Who was always there, and now I'm completely alone.
So, you keep going, hoping one of the gambles comes off.
Wondering if I would be coming back or not.

Keep that with you at all times.
When she came to this country after the war.
From her superiors for more than 10 years.

A snow rose. No.
Have been very popular in Europe and South America for years.
Has always treated me with the utmost respect... With loyalty.
Has been highly effective.
Right there. That's right.
The only thing I've ever gotten paid for is being pretty.
You have made a living watching others.
Towards the sea and your back therefore.
Being a little too vulnerable.
All while living under the threat
And our reservations are good for another week,
Came strong and kept it coming.
All the way from highway 10? Yes. I wear chanteuse.
 keep on lifting
All the way to the yellow sun of the earth.
Fought my way to the rendezvous and here we are.
Approaching Mongolia.
I'm just achy and tired from all the travel,
And straight on 'til morning.
Stationed without incident at camp Pendleton until last night.
Call him names. Run him down all the time.
And kept speaking evil of me.
Ride off into the sunset? Live happily ever after?
Every second of the day.
All this lying about where I've been.
And he says that a wolf is attacking his sheep. - yes.
And you're lying to me now.
She kept calling.
Who has been pleased to take unto thyself the soul of this thy servant,
And a parrot flew down and landed on his shoulder and said,
Been nothing but trouble since.
Until the end of semester.
haven't said a word.
That has guarded the temple for centuries
have had the courage to fight poverty.
Trust me, he's got fangs.
Speak for yourself.
What does it look like? It's a mock - up.
It's easy to identify one person
It just knocks me out.
Those look like our men. - you think this plan will really work?
And he definitely looks guilty!
His mouth betrays his words
You obviously don't have satellite or cable, sir. Up to 200 channels.
You look like you don't belong here, and you definitely don't belong under the car.
You ought to get you a hat that says "undercover cop".
You obviously haven't partied with pharmaceutical reps.
You just look like you can move.
I could tell you were spoilt.
Looking at you I could tell that it was the first time for you.
I can tell that you're a thief!
You are the handsome one.
One look and I know you're an Aquarius you're as beautiful as a flower
Whoever stole the mattress also broke that award
You CAH tell from the big breasts
Looks exactly like a kept woman
She totally fits the part of a murderer.
You see a picture of your son,
Can you see? See what?
Who would kill you as soon as look at you.
Once things were evened up, she pulled me off of him.
You'll start stutter if you only see him.
Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks,
I see that man, I get an immediate urge to wind him up.
Now, when you see him, just point him out to me, okay?
As soon as you see him, take him.
I knew he was the one the moment I saw him.
You see him, you call me.
He makes me pissed off.
And every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
As soon as I saw him, I took off.
I see that coming, and I'm out the door.
Breaking my heart, watching him punch the air like he thinks it's gonna punch back.
Call the second you see his pickup. Let it ring once.
Would run at the fearful sight of his horse hooves.
His heart will stop at the very sight of you
His heart will stop at the very sight of you or he doesn't deserve to live.
And as soon as you came forward like this, I thought Oh, here we go.
Ah, I see you two have a book open there,
So when you see your mama.
Bite you as soon as look at you, those savages! Bite you?
At the sight of you can say sorry
Probably gotta watch your figure, your line of work.
You are a sight for sore eyes.
I am sick once seeing you.
I always want to play when I see you.
When I look at you, I see everything I've ever wanted.
I knew it that moment I saw you, you were special.
I see you and start defending myself.
On seeing you, I felt you had come with some purpose in mind.
I look at you, and I feel nauseous.
Seeing you gave me such a turn.
As soon as I saw your team.
But as soon as I looked into your eyes, I knew.
We see some movement, we just keep firing till he's dead.
You see any vampires, you shoot to kill.
It's the first thing people see whenever they look at us together.

I get hiccups when I meet a girl I like
As soon as he saw the reporter, he started bashing him
I never could stand the sight

You let me know as soon as they come
You gotta walk up to the hottest thing in a place; otherwise, you're finished.
And is jealous of her son,
As soon as she saw her she said,
I see her holding a dead moose,
When I look at her it breaks my heart.
Her, I think she was frigid
See I look at them now and I think what I said to you. It's your job.
Just seeing it gives you an idea.
Now every time I look at me, I think of you.
When it comes to you, how can I forget?
There was that whiny thing in the short skirt,
Saw it, fell in love with it, bought it on sight.
I recognized you immediately.
Feel dizzy once you see handsome guys?
First sign of trouble, you give that coyote howl.
And as soon as I saw what we had, I was so happy.
They crossed the street when I approached,
They got me away from my post just long enough
When I give the signal, do it.
I look at my wife, my son, and I.
Get out every time we see a bulldozer?
Little spring flowers with blue in them that come up first.
Whenever you see a ship, you run down quick.
Once we saw that blood, we knew you'd be showing up.
When they're looking at a beautiful girl.
As soon as we see the submarine, we alert the guard station over there.
His little face just lights up with joy.
You see an opening,
So, one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits
That Butler always gave me the shivers.
And once I saw the word "arson," I freaked.
They see a chance to jump ahead of you,
Every time I see Sasha, I feel like we betrayed him.
Show me a skirt, and my brain simply whirls.
Started reading this file,
One look at this jewelry box, the empress will think we have the real Anastasia.
Since I see this beautiful beach,
One look at these man - boobs and I was in, huh?
You know, it makes you sad, it makes you.
I saw this color and thought of you.
It all clicked when I saw the implant.
Now, as soon as I saw those dilated pupils, I knew that could only mean one thing,
I knew that the minute I saw this shit hole.
Not when there's money involved.

But eyes reveal a wife gone fucking mad!
The right sleeve of an Internet porn addict,
When l see hearty eaters, l want to cook.

Pretty sure she's a lesbian.
Soon as I opened that letter, it went right into my briefcase.
Who is obviously not your doctor?
You didn't knit this.
Not a pleasant specimen.
Perfect typecasting, they could be Buchenwald guards.
You just seemed special.
It's not, like, all trained and perfect.
A magic bloody mystery tour by the way it's decked out.
He's bulky, kind of heavy - set.
Like he'd seen things, bad things.
Off to the gaming tables.
She's a keeper. Hang on to her.
Made me sick just to look at it.
I can see.
Makes good reading.
Or a boat on a wall for 11 years,
Of course she is.
Was never answerable to the bottom line.
You'd make one hell of a target.
That self-lacerating crap reeks of her.
He 's, uh, apparently fond of wrought iron.
Is the same as my high school?
It's got Takeda's stamp all over it.
Off the wall false.
It's totally fake - looking.
The baby is clearly Mexican! So, you know, the swirl is out.
Ah, the smell of a genius.
This is her handiwork, her latest triumph.
Must be good stuff.
Sure have a great pitcher's hands.
This was it.
I mean, you're obviously hung over.
Typical landlubbers. Aye, no stamina these days.
God and country for all to see. Am I about right?

It's got the mill creek 'SM. O. All over it.
Rookie move.

Mercenaries, by the look of it.
Not - significant is a big word.
He wasn't planning no sea voyage.
She must be important.
That figures.
Entirely different kind of chinks.
He doesn't look sincere.
Knew he had to be taking something for his cholesterol.
Can't you tell？
You can tell just by looking.
You'll figure it out.
Well, it's no secret how they got in.
It's the type, sweetie.
That brought to mind the happy hippos in fantasia.
You can see he Hasn't
He won't do it. I can see it in his eyes. He won't kill me.
To know it when I see it.
didn't believe you the first time.
No mistake in what you're in the mood tonight, is there?
It's pretty obvious you guys are together.
You must be a new around here, ah?
You look like the friends. You do. - hi.
It didn't look like nothing.
Looks like you're dressed for business.
Like you're wearing my clothes.
I think I can tell who wrapped that.
You can already tell which brother - who is this beautiful woman?
That's easy, boss
Sure he's not done military service owing to his Filthy rich father.
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.
She's a total skank, dude.
Yeah. See how well l did?
So we know that they were purchased together
Looks like he knows how to have a good time.
That looks like I just threw it together this afternoon?
Well, it looks like a gift.
Obviously she is your ex. Probably not your mother.
They're healing their legs,
It was amateur night, you could tell.
I know corn starch powder when I see it.
This has got you - know - who's paw prints all over it.
Witness protection, if I ever saw.
Yeah, I'll bet.
I know of things by just a glance
And you smelled like a magazine insert.
When a gun doesn't have any bullets.
You can sure tell which is Steve 's.
And the dregs of humanity, from the looks of it.
It don't take a whiz to know that only a desperate man would drop his pants
A bit of an oddball, apparently.
Admittedly it's only a worm.
You can tell that this is a tedious job
I can readily see something wrong with this fish
You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage.
No stranger to the bench press.
With Frankie Reynolds is gonna look pretty damn suspicious.
I'm seeing big pores and mousy roots.
The dead body's kind of a giveaway.
It was the hat.
You look like a generous man. Oh do I?
That makes me laugh.
One - now it's my turn!
I imagine people like the last gentleman come out of the woodwork at a time like this.
Somebody might want to tell her about caller ID.
It seemed solid enough. Hoggle!

We started jamming their communications as soon as they were in sight.
The first peep from him, you come to the grown - ups.
Soon as I saw him, I noticed.
When they see Bernie, they're terrified. Terrified.
I saw you arrive and couldn't help admiring you.
One look at you, it's plain as day.
You're such a darling.
The moment l saw you.
The pain in my chest vanished.
That sees you in a crisis and then comes galloping to your rescue.
I saw it and I thought,
As soon as they see a tiny wave, they catch it!
Because you're never - ja, because we are never going to win.
First glimpse, tell me? Yes, sir.
The moment you saw me. And you didn't say anything.
Throws up on me when he looks at me.
He saw me and yielded.
I am just hopeless with numbers.
We see a white coat, our vital statistics go through the fucking roof.
I know a student's best work when I see it.
I saw the fancy invitation and I couldn't help myself.
And once he saw that it was completely empty, he locked him inside.
The minute l see those guys.

I guess I don't have to ask about cause of death.
The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.

It's funny. - what's funny?
Really? - does that come as a shock?
Really? How do you know that? Oh, don't sound so smart.
Do you think so? - I'm convinced you will.
We are? Yeah.
It doesn't make sense. Why would a cop dress up as a cop?
Pricey. Its unique.
Shut them really tight
Blink and you'll miss them, but we got them.
A super being who could move in the blink of an eye.
We've forgotten everything in a blink.
In the blink of an eye, you'll be grown and gone.
It is like, if you blink your eyes, you are already through the town.
Stole my wallet a while back.
It will be over in the blink of an eye.
Went under in the blink of an eye,
In a blink of an eyelid messages travel from Calcutta to Delhi
Not a moment ago! How extraordinary.
Next second.
He disappeared in a second
You blink, it'll be over. Two seconds.
It all happened so fast after that.
Running so imminent that I can barely think.
Well, this is gonna be over before you even know it starts. Mm - hmm.
In a flash it was over! A victorious blow!
A new compound for a flash!
Blink and die, scumbags.
It flies right on by.
It's over in the blink of an eye.
It'll be over in a flash so don't get nervous
It 'l be over in a flash so don't get nervous
Or 60,000, in the blink of an eye.
It'll be over before you know it?
Like the blink of an eye. - yeah.
He'll have me in the stocks
They'll rip you to pieces before you could blink.
They would have made short work of him.
And the next, we're in limbo.
My daughter is starting to date, you know? How did that happen?
And next thing I know, I can't get into my house,
The next, I'm sipping champagne in l. A.
In the blink of an eye, I've become an old man!
How can my little niece and nephew have grown up so when I wasn't looking?
And just like that, my baby girl became a teenager.
The next, only shoes.
About blinking time!
It's just been a while.
Like, in the blink of an eye.
Three of them gone before you could wink.
She may swallow you whole before you can blink.
Only a matter of time, eh?
Before you turn around, they'll be in high school, dating.
Blink of an eye.
That's eight of them now, on the blink.
Very, very soon it's gonna be a brand new year.
Is that it happens in the blink of an eye.
I'll be back before you know it with your wedding ring.
In the blink of an eye, you'll be grown and gone.
We made a fortune in no time.
Now it's today. It's today?
I blinked, and then I - I was waking up in your waiting room, except I wasn't asleep!
You blink.
Vaporized an entire city in the blink of an eye.
Blink and you just might miss it.
In a flash, the life we knew is gone forever.
In the blink of an eye, I can go wherever I want,
Look them in the eyes, without blinking.
You don't blink, you don't think, you don't hesitate.
Ever seen.
It's all in the eyes, apparently.
With a sharp eye for early Danish modern.

What you see is what you get.
I want to see them through.
About to take that next step.

It's obvious, huh?
That obvious?
I can see it, no need to listen？
You knew with one look about silver star.
And the cipher was waiting.
One guy alone who would see her first
You saw my coin right away

You could actually see and recognize the great lakes.
Looking straight through you, like she knew all your secrets.

You were surely stand out in the battle field.
One look into mine and they would have full knowledge.
It sure as hell looked like he was living out of there.
You could tell right away.
And I know a good investment when I see one.
Is it so obvious I'm not?
You can tell that just by looking.
When there's something one of you isn't saying.
It's obvious. Brian knows it.

First thing I saw was wean years and flames all over.
At first glance, there seems no sign of climate change here at Cape Washington.
And it looks like me as a designer.
You look over, hundreds of feet down to the sea.
Poo as far as the eye can see.
Looking at 2 lookouts right now. What are the odds of you getting inside?
Now, at first glance, it looks like a very impressive
Just by looking at it, it's the same as Lee Jae - Jun.
At first glance, it looked like a compound fracture.
You don't need to eat off it. Just give it a good once over.
It's hidden from plain sight.
And one eye on all of you.
With one eye on the horizon, one eye on the truth,
Eye on the road, eye on the machine gun!
And when you meet one, it is intoxicating.
Instant recognition.
Tend to recognize, it's stalling.
At first glance, it looks fine.
don't you ever look at me.
don't even look at him. Just. No eye contact.
It's endless. We'll stay in touch here.
Not even a blinker.
And the big gamble doesn't work, all bets are off.
Everything's on the line here, people.

And see the same stupid face lying next to you?
 sleep all day out all night
Into a deep and troubled sleep.
Did you sleep well? - like a log. How about you?
You sleep, you don't know if you're coming back.
When I did sleep, I'd have dreams, I'd wake up.
And see more in that instant than most people will ever see?
To see how a group of medieval masons created a building of such wonder
Takes a look at how humanity is inherently suspicious

Just on a whim, I thought,
For a while, I thought I was meant to be by your side.
And for an instant, I feel like if I just turn around and look,
Only suddenly, there are a few too many hands.
Suddenly, my whole life changed
For one brief moment I saw all the bolts silhouetted.
For a second, everything was just like it used to be.
All of a sudden everything just feels out of control.
In an instant... There was this guy who
Who was too quickly taken from this life.
Leaving all troubles behind
It's very quick.
just in a flash.
They drop like that.

You had a lot of money whenever I saw you
The sight of you has revived my love.
I was wet the moment I saw you.
The minute I met you, I knew we'd be friends.
Whenever I see you my heart.
And the sight of you passed straight through me like an arrow.
But it sings continuously for the chief
L freeze when l see a girl
As soon as I see her, I'm gonna lose my nerve.
Shoot 'em fast, and right between the eyes. Mm - hm.
The moment that you do, drop to the ground.
He'll open fire as soon as he sees our faces.
You just know when you meet one.
I will know my father as soon as I see him.
So the first sign of a test tube, complain about damaging the note.
Whenever I see pink, I go crazy.
He sees a beautiful woman, he doesn't think.
Take it out when you see the rapist
That woman drives you crazy!
Once I saw lemon.
Because when it comes to needles, he's so not butch.
You see a middle easterner on an aircraft
How you were sick when you even saw one?
Pot gives him an appetite.
His face - it looks familiar.
I knew when I saw you.
The moment that you met them really clearly.
He gets a little nervous around ahority figures.
Death blow raging InK!
Soon as I get off the elevator, they rushto the little castle and.
As soon as the guy sees me, he starts bawling like a little girl.
Tucked in your pants,
When we found this, we called you.
She is thrilled to meet Wu seed.
Now look alive.
This stuff is like catnip for you guys, huh?
I knew the spray - tan twosome were dodgy soon as I saw them.
Euphoria.
Love at first sight.
Euphoria. Euphoria.
Love at first sight, right?
Love at first sight?
On my husband.
Euphoria. What?
Love at first sight is a myth.
I think it's wonderful! Love at first sight.
Love at first sight is what she said.
Love at first sight? For me it was.
They fell in love and been together since.
A crush! I'm not a kid. So why do you blush every time you see me then?
Call it... I don't know.
I know love at first sight when I see it.
At first sight. I knew it. Then?
Crushes are by nature idealized, unrealistic.
And marry her.
"First time we met" stories.
So it's a crash romance? Yeah that's it.
You just get that feeling, right?
Love at first sight! Jailhouse romance.
Love at first sight. The real thing!
Fell in love, and wed just before liftoff.
So, head over heels or a broken heart?
You - you're an animal.
The brocades all look great
It's not easy to fall in love at first sight
And you just give that up on day one?
And still feels free to criticize.
All making out and stuff.
And you have to give me a cold shower in ourfirst meeting.
Face - first. Literally.
Well, it would have been really rude to take one look at him and say, "see you".
Brothers with a... Singular hability to piss each other off
Hello, good to see you again, "part of the conversation"?
I should have known it was you as soon as I saw you.
I sized you up the moment we met.
Running for cover at the first whiff of unpopularity.
For the black - leather / guitar - player type.
Yeah, Canada, too.
Sauce for the goose, right?
the remnants of the medieval worldview.
One thing about being on top of the world
You see everything and it's all hanging out.
Oh! Plain view. Stop.
Plain view. Stop it!
Of all directions, over.
And take in an unparalleled view.
Business.
Plain view. Stop.
The new moon has made her a virgin again.
And wake up at noon, still tired.
I slept well. No insomnia.
Dream of bedbugs tonight.
Like I just woke upfrom a 38 - year nap.
I slept for 70 years, sir. I think I've had my fill.
Having a sleep - over.
A night of uninterrupted sleep was.
See you first thing in the morning.
And then this morning, I just wanted to get to school.
When morning doth break
Everything will look better in the morning.
Just woke up and.
Everything will be better in the morning.
You may wake up to find all the answers you've been looking for.
Is wake up from this dream.
You'll feel better after a good night's sleep.
Had to wake up and find this.
They wake up to regret it.
Waking up one day and finding out you're invisible.
And wake up and out side of Vietnam,
You just... You just wake up, and you're in a motel room.
And then woke up to an empty bed and a big, empty bank account.
And wake up in heaven
And a good night of sleep. Come morning I'm a Mexican.
I'd wake up and the dream would just die.
You woke up, you had some coffee, maybe a nice jog in the park.
You wake up in a strange place, wearing strange clothes.
Probably have maid's quarters before the night is through.
This morning when I woke up I was really annoyed with some of the other models
And when you wake up, we'll be somewhere else.
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning and be in the movie business?
She wakes up to breakfast cooked on a campfire.
I woke up here.
She wakes up the governor's wife.
And expect good things to happen,
Next to someone who had his back like you did.
Things will be better in the morning.
And then waking up later and it's the future.
When I woke up this morning that I would end up here
So, I woke up this morning to a flood of e-mails and video posts.
I woke up from a nap and, uh, everything went from really small to really huge.
It would be nice to wake up to some of that.
You wake up, you're battered, you're bruised, you don't know where you are or how you got there.
When I wake up, everything's gonna be fine.
And then I woke up and had no idea how I got here.
And when they open, the sun
A few may be all we need.
Or, once in a while, a quarter.
How about a dime? Give it to me.
Face on a dime!
A dime? What's that mean?
Ten cents, eh? Oh, that's terrible.
A dime here, a quarter there.
Found a dead gator. That
One sideways look from a superior.
Square - off.
Hair trigger.
Bang. Yeah. In chicks.
"Imminent." I've got people to protect.
Immediate and terrible war.
Governments who stood on the brink of conflict
Qick on the trigger was in the lead
Flashpoint. S01E05
Quick on the trigger was in the lead
When it comes to bugs, slime, crud and compost, you're the man.
And that tickle is a reminder of your gift.
I touch your skin.
For all your words and actions.
During the talks, where did the matter reach?
Go all quiet.
Just total fucking silence. Two can play at that game, smart guy.
Tongue - tied, brother?
And say nothing. That's right.

Quiet, kept to himself - you know, the usual homicidal - maniac routine.
With just watching you walk out that door.
One wrong word and he could escalate. You gotta trust me on this here, buddy.
Deal. 20 dollars.
A deal? Yeah.
Agreed.
Done deal!
Deal. Deal.
Okay. Deal. deal.

So we have a deal. Good!
Promise. When? What time?
Here's the deal. Take your tickets, go to your seats.

Please do. You got a good
Deal. You're the best.

On that note, I will say good - bye, and thank you for coming.
Word. Bye, everyone.
Count on it. Bye, now. Bless you.
Deal's a deal. I'll be in touch with final instructions.
Deal. Plus a week's free tapas.
All right, partner.
Good call, ray - gay.

Do we have a deal? Yeah. Thank you, principal Kwan.
That is my best deal, OK.
Then it's a deal!
Okay. Promise? Promise.

Done deal. Amen to that.
Done. I'll be there.

Do we have a deal?
Deal. - yeah.
Any girl, right? Yeah.
Will do. Okay.
Right. Then we agree. Now scram.
Period. I know, but, I'm not gonna be around much longer.
You're on. - hold on.
No questions asked, no exceptions. Excuse me?
That's a promise, buddy.
Alright. Boss.
I promise. - you do? Now, my little artist.
With bells on. Thanks for the invite.
This is hard evidence of the murders.
We got a deal? Great.
Deal ?- deal.
It's a deal. Now I'd like you to shake.
The worst way.
If I could use one word to sum up
And that, in a nutshell, is the story of your life.
In a word, my Lord, in the long term
The simple answer is, we don't know.
So now all I want is a body in my bed at night, briefly.
Short answer, yes. A pity.
All in all, you are vile
In short, a great day for new York city.
Isn't that the problem in a nutshell?
Who lived and who died.
Not for quids.
It's a long story. I 'll - I'll tell you when I see you.
It's difficult to explain, m 'lady.
By the way, if I ever catch one of you messing with my things.
I got no easy answers. But what I do know is
Fighting words.
Down like a clown, Charlie B - broooowww
Down like a clown, Charlie Br.
A man has said.
Down like a clown, Charlie Br - brown.
I'll keep my promise
What's been said cannot be undone
Words they say and mean.
But I gave my word. Yes, so you did, Jim.
A man's word is as good as a bond. It shouldn't be changed.
Down like a clown, Charlie browh... Bro - uh - own.
Had nothing to say when he left
Simply put, he is exactly the sort of figure.
Suffice it to say that I apologize in advance
Everything. Oh.
Long story, but we're friends now. Gotta go. Got a line on a private jet in Galveston.
It's complicated. I'm getting closer, though.
It's complicated. - and you and ayim,
A lot of work, you know?
It's complicated. It's complicated when you're a liar.
It's a long story. Did it involve a sharp blow to the head?
It's complicated. I can imagine, dear client,
It's complicated. Look, I can't.
It's complicated.
don't get me started.
That's the long story.
It 'a long story, but I'm working on a new book on poker underground.
It's too insane for words. What happened?
Well, let's just say love can be complicated.
It's kind of long. Shut the fuck up!
Which part... The immaculate tattoo,
Long story. Stick around and I'll tell you.
It's kinda hard to say, miss. She's not herself.
Bad breakup. Long story.
it's... A long story. Of course.
T was like a dream
It's complicated. No, it's simple.
It's complicated. See, I am a former police.
It's a long story. I gotta get out of this garage.
It's complicated! I bet it is.
Mmm, it's a long story, but I want you to meet
It's a long story. L was related to the Khan
It's kind of hard to describe. Look, I gotta go.
It's complicated. You seem pretty ballsy to me.
Long story. Hence, many things on my mind.
It's complicated, isn't it?
Long story. it's... don't ask.
Hard to explain. Things are different now.
It's complicated. Yes?
Long story, short I was tied to a delusional dog and dragged across the country.
It's complicated, buddy.
It's really complicated. It has to do with one of my cases.
It's more complicated. It's war.
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.
Not in so many words. How many words does it take?
Yeah, a long story. I'll bet.
It's hard to explain. Involves your crazy dad.
It's a long story, sir,
Long story short,
It's a long story, can I help ya?
Two girls, one cop.
With another right to the head. Another right. And another.
Put it in here... Brand new!
Just as soon as I can book a ticket.
I'm going to leave this country, just as soon as I can book a ticket.
I'll find a room and email you.
As soon as you make the I. D., you leave.
One, it is an absolute honor to meet you.
We just hit it off immediately.
Everywhere we went in Los Angeles with the traditional wedding thing,
One, send him home, two, sterilize the o. R.,
You put her on, she's going away for 15 years.
Let's be sensible. - so you weren't being sensible?
The bleachers at Fenway.
Always remember who you are, work harder than everyone else
Then some creep shot him in the head in a hold - up.
Braddock lands a hard right to the head. Max swats him away with utter contempt.
Landing a vicious right to the
A base hit!
Had that walk - off hit to win the '97 series.
He throws a left hook. And another.
And a left hook jars the challenger.
A left to the body.
A left. A right. Another left.
A sharp left. Again, a hard right.
A left to the body. Baer, again with the right.
A hard left hand to the body, and Robinson is driven out of the ring
A left to the chin, a right to the head, and he's down!
A fastball, up and in, hits Uggla in the back.
A glove save. Now the puck bounces away from Lidstrom out to center
There's a right cross, and another, and another!
He gets some wood on that one!
A battle won cancels every other bad action?
A little tap down the line.
and here's a long drive hit deep into left center field.
A spark suddenly turns the capsule into an inferno.
Sweet tackle. Wow!
And it hit another kid so hard, his eye popped out.
Here's a block, another one and another one and another one!
Square on the nose! - he's got a glass jaw.
A straight shot. - Ooh, ow.
A straight shot. Ooh, ow.
Journalist shot dead in his flat.
Boy, one swipe of that.
Huge right hook

It's a slam dunk, boss.
The ko. On my Bo.
Hard punch slams him to the canvas.
There's a long drive! It's gonna be, I believe.
Can of corn, and Robinson is out.
He gave her a powerful kick!
He actually knows.
You do it whenever you talk about your pro career.
They made up, so they fired us with a measly sum!
A little calamity - that's worth talking about.
One, form a barrier.
Word Association. Excuse me?
It's so stupid how they spell those words the same.
Try it.
Should be easy enough to find out.
First response!
I try.
Worth a try. Check that out.
Nice try, though.
First... Shit!
God damn it. - we got enough!
$500 for a goddamn projector? Fuck you.
We started whalingon each other.
Verisimilitude.
Be right about something?
I couldn't agree more.
Nailed it!
Yeah. Spot on, mate.
No question. Impotent?
Pun intended.
Pun intended. Two different victims, two different amputations.
Pun intended. It wasn't a pun.
Wordplay. That is solid.
A pun, yeah - yeah.
It's a pun.
 for beating the shit out of me
You said just enough.
Self-fulfilling prophecy.
It's how he puts everything.
Tells me that exact thing.
He might be eavesdropping. - no, it's time for his rounds.
didn't take much convincing.
And if you try to tell him he drinks too much, a row.
Which sounds horribly cheesy now that I'm saying it aloud.
When it comes to you, I happen to agree with her.
He isn't cautious of technology.
The funny thing about stegosaurus.
Speaking of Christmas, here are the 2 and 1/2 wise men.
Talking about women like he's 20 years old.
When it comes to religion, Karl Marx got it right.
But when it comes time to actuallgetting things done,
He was completely lost, talking about some Glen.
He's quite skittish when the subject of sex comes up. No, I'm not.
This must be torture for you, me talking about my wedding.
That Mr. Obama thinks himself wiser than Thomas Jefferson
And you can't seem to say
I get talking about baseball, I cannot stop.
Speaking of love, I started thinking about that poodle
Okay, that whole talking about Samantha
This upset him so much
Oh, he's so vague about it.
When it comes down to it, I do. I mean, I got to admit I want to be their friend.
My dad is on Natalie's team when it comes to this, uh,
When you say shine, your eyes go all buggy like a retarded dragonfly.
We had an M.O. Thought it was for money. She was hysterical.
Oh, that seemed to get their attention.
When it comes to cash, nobody can be trusted.
By the time you get to OvaItine.
I can be exuberant when I talk about music.
Without becoming hysterical.
The second incantation was supposed to put out the fire,
People say "too easy" and bad things happen.
Who was getting all judge Judy on me.
To be honest, yes. - who?
Honestly, no. - but you have the hots for her?
She is here already.
Now I want pie.
It makes me kind of mad.
And it makes her nervous when I say I'm cutting people open.
If I talk, I'll blow my top.
We were just talking about you!
Things never turn out well when you say "one last mission".
I'm feeling the answer come to me right now.
Tell me about Paula. - for the love of
Two little blinks, just like that, when he lies.
One word about your marriage and the weather seems transformed!
Talk about whims. - now look here, Johan!
Oh, speaking of birds, I was thinking about Thanksgiving,
It ain't never enough talking when you talking about love, brother.
Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.
There's no stopping you once you've started.
I get a little anxious just talking about it.
Well, soon the truth will be out, that I cannot bear children.
Say the wrong thing and you'll crush him.
One, please. How much is it? That's 7.50.
Promie looks in a good mood today.
Promises, promises.
Promie has grown up in a small town right?
Promie told me so.
Promie, who told you to come here?
Promie asked when I'll marry her.
Always shocks me to read something like that.
Giving once is like giving a million times.
Who? Anne lively.
Who doesn't? - you. You don't.
You counter offer with your poisoned lips.
Whenever his personal life came up,
That's what you always do. When it gets tough, you walk away.
It's that when it comes to Harvard, sometimes I get a little tunneI vision.
My cracks every time I talk about it.
You've been vague about that night, about what happened.
All this talk about food is getting me hungry.
And talk for hours.
For weeks or months or years,
All this talk about my family 's
They're not too keen on talking to the law, that's for damn sure.
They're happy as long as we're all talking about U of a
I'm glad we got rid of them. - yes, things got a bit too festive.
I rushed right over right after curtain.
Thank you. Now tell me,
Thank you. And I hear you have a son.

Badly? Well.

Your obsessions, your failures with work, marriage, and parenthood.
I feel like this is where I belong now.

Crash and burn, huh, Mav?
One was marked "cloak room," and the other "valuables.
One pallet could be worth 400-500 thou easily.
Truckloads of them.
Poor he may be, but we could build up friendship
Poor.
Loss and possession, death and life are one.
Nothing to look forward to but abject poverty.
We're bankrupt!
Even though they have hardly any rights and no money, and simply work for the big guy.
abject poverty, starvation.
The idea of the "terrible mother" is best illustrated in world mythology
Typical.
It's always been the practice
Rather outspoken in his praise of Mr. Pinckney.
It's the uniform.
Typical. Typical.
Always has been and always will be.
Always have. You read me?
Always have. But your client's wife was guilty of contributory negligence.
That's the rule.
Always. Good.

Season after season. Quite sad,
As soon as I won the challenge,
Lather, rinse, repeat three times.
Coming downstairs.
Crew.

Just leave the hotel?
Just walk away?

From his mother?
Get the hell out of there?
LeavIng wIth0ut a w0rd ls the w0rst thIng t0 d0
It'd be great to get away.
You go and you disappear?
The "good" sister that just walked away.
The first time we walked out there was crazy.
After we pack up I'm not going to be around for another year.
They forget you once you leave
For four months. I'd like to have a little fun.
He'd be gone six, seven months at a time.
It has been a year.
And we went for five years.
For the ten years.
Just that moment.
Oh, what good's a scout who goes off and doesn't report but every three days?
Go away. Hoggle, you've come to help me.
