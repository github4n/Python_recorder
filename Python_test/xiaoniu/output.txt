Bitcoin fell below $6, 000 on Tuesday, hitting a six-week low, as other major cryptocurrencies fell. 
Bitcoin fell as much as 6 per cent to $5,880, its lowest level since June 29, according to Reuters data based on the Bitstamp exchange. 
"His mission is too big to meet investors' quarterly expectations. Our guess is that he has a one-third chance of meeting his privatisation targets." 
In the first half of this year, per capita consumer spending in Beijing, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Fujian and Liaoning ranged from 10,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan. 
The data also showed that the most consumed categories were food, tobacco, alcohol, housing and transport communications. 
At the national level, per capita expenditure on sports and fitness increased by 39.3 per cent, while per capita expenditure on medical services increased by 24.6 per cent and per capita expenditure on hotel accommodation by 37.8 per cent. 
Consumer spending per capita on cosmetics, adult education and pre-school education/training showed double-digit growth. 
China's soybean imports may drop by more than 10 million tons this year, down more than 10 percent from last year, due to the expansion of domestic soybean production and the promotion of soybean substitutes, analysts said. 
China's car imports surged in July after low tax rates took effect, according to data. 
In July, China imported 165,000 cars and chassis, up 50 per cent from a year earlier, according to the General Administration of Customs. 
In dollar terms, the value of imported cars rose 72 per cent to $7.38bn in July. 
China has been opening its doors wider to the world with a series of incentives aimed at expanding imports, including lowering tariffs on cars and car parts. 
Many car brands, including Volvo, Audi and Lexus, have previously announced plans to lower the price of cars imported into China following tariffs cuts. 
The turmoil has worried the Turkish people, who see it as a brewing economic crisis. 
In the long run, the Turkish economic crisis could make fewer Turks buy the company's products. 
China's mobile game industry is gaining momentum as technology-savvy millennials gain purchasing power. 
In the first half of this year, China's game market generated 105 billion yuan in sales, up 5.2 percent from a year earlier, according to a report from Gamma Data, an industry database. 
Among them, the mobile game market sales revenue of 63.41 billion yuan, accounting for 60.4%, mobile games is still the world's largest game market growth in China's main driving force. 
In the first half of this year, the number of mobile gamers rose 5.4 percent year-on-year to 460 million, or 87 percent of the country's total number of gamers. Most of these players were born in the 1990s and early 2000s, a group known as the "millennials". 
In the first half of this year, women game enthusiasts contributed 24.15 billion yuan to domestic game sales, up 13.5 percent year-on-year, the report said. 
China's securities regulator has issued a statement on improving the delisting system. 
The revised system states that companies that commit acts that jeopardize national security, public safety or public health safety will have their listing suspended or terminated. 
This is the first time that companies involved in public health threats will be forced to withdraw from the market. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission also made it clear that companies involved in fraud and material disclosure violations would be suspended or terminated from listing. 
China set up a delisting mechanism in 2014, but authorities said in March that stricter delisting rules were needed to keep stocks healthy and protect the interests of small investors. 
In May, the Shanghai Stock Exchange terminated the listing of the two companies, while the Shenzhen Stock Exchange also terminated the listing of another company. 
SHANGHAI-Starbucks has been the undisputed king of coffee in China for many years. 
In a country of tea lovers, it has created a market for coffee drinkers, making money from a wave of affluent Chinese who see Starbucks as an "ideal brand". China quickly became the coffee chain's second-largest market after the United States. 
But Starbucks' dominance in China is increasingly undermined as China's economic growth slows and rivals try to target coffee drinkers. 
On Thursday, the company announced a so-called "new retail" strategic partnership with Chinese tech giant Alibaba to revive its business in China. 
Beginning in December, Hainan Province will further relax the tax exemption policy to promote tourism and domestic consumption. 
In a statement posted on its website, the Ministry of Finance said it would increase the tax-free shopping limit for domestic and foreign tourists and island residents to 30,000 yuan per person per year, from the current 16,000 yuan. 
Duty-free items will be added to the list of medical devices, including hearing aids, vision trainers, home respiratory support equipment and so on. 
According to the statement, a maximum of two pieces can be purchased per person at a time. 
Wang Huiping, deputy director of the Hainan Provincial Finance Department, said the new changes will help bring more luxury goods to the domestic market and more convenience to tourists. He also said that the new deal will attract more tourists to the island and promote the development of the service industry. 
From January to October this year, Hainan province consumed 7.95 billion yuan worth of duty-free goods, up 23% from a year earlier, according to the provincial government. 
Last year, tax-free sales in Hainan reached 8.016 billion yuan, up 32% from 2016. 
Part of the original revolving staircase of the Eiffel Tower was sold at an auction in Paris for 169,000 euros by a Middle Eastern collector, three times the original estimate, Eid auction house said on Tuesday. 
The staircase, from a private collection in Canada, consists of 25 steps, 4.3 meters high, between the second and third floors of the Eiffel Tower, a landmark in Paris, built in 1889. 
When the elevator was installed in 1983, it was removed and cut into 24 sections ranging in length from 2 to 9 metres. 
One of them has been kept on the first floor of the Eiffel Tower since then, and three others have been donated to three French museums. 
The other 20 paragraphs were first auctioned on 1 December 1983. 
In 2016, an Asian collector paid 523,800 euros for a staircase in the Eiffel Tower, more than 10 times the estimate. 
This pilot project is one way to demonstrate "coffee paper cups for coffee paper cups". So says Jay Hunsberger, vice president of sales for North America at Sustana's used paper cup recycling mill. 
At a paper mill, these cups mix well with water and then use a 7-foot-long screw cone to separate the plastic lining from the paper cup to prevent it from getting wet. 
After inspection and cleaning, the fibers are separated and then sent to WestRock, a packaging company, to be made into cardboard. At a third processing company, Seda Cardboard, the Starbucks logo will be printed and shaped into a new paper cup. 
"There has been a misunderstanding in the industry about the recyclability of PVC coated cardboard." Says Mike Mueller, a senior product marketing manager at WestRock. 
"I think this is the biggest obstacle to mass recycling of the package." WestRock's eight own paper mills recently accepted the cups as well as paper food packaging. 
It is generally considered difficult or expensive to separate the plastic lining from the cup or to remove coffee stains. 
But Hunsberger says it's no more expensive than recycling plain paper, and it's the same whether it's used or not. Prior to piloting the project with Starbucks, Sustana began routinely recycling other coated paper containers such as milk cartons. 
One of the challenges is supply, which makes it difficult for a paper mill to predict how many cups can be recycled, making it more difficult for it to function effectively. But for paper mills with a constant flow of recycled cups, this is not difficult to operate. 
"Materials can be handled differently and you need to adjust the process to accommodate them, but if it becomes a long-term process, you just need to adapt to work." 
Seattle, New York City, Washington, D.C., and other cities are also recycling paper cups. The latest city to recycle coffee cups is Denver, which recently sent two truckloads of about 88,000 cups to Sustana. 
Starbucks uses recycled paper cups for 10% of its new paper cups, with the goal of doubling them by 2020. If Starbucks decides to get enough of its own recycled fiber cups, which are in line with the latest commissioning process, it will need more paper mills and local recycling bins to collect the cups. 
Current paper-processing equipment is not 100 per cent recyclable, but recycled fiber can reach 40 to 50 per cent, making it even more aggressive for Starbucks and other cafes. 
China recently disclosed for the first time the annual return on investment in basic endowment insurance funds. 
According to the latest data released by the National Council of Social Security Funds (NCSF), the total investment income of the basic endowment insurance fund reached 8.78 billion yuan in 2017, with an annual rate of return of 5.23 per cent. 
In December 2016, local governments began commissioning the Social Security Fund to run the investable portion of its vast pool of pension assets in search of higher returns, the first time the Fund has reported annual returns since it was commissioned. 
In China, locally managed endowment insurance funds are usually deposited in banks or used to purchase treasury bonds with an annual yield of 2-3%. These yields are close to so-called risk-free interest rates but well below market averages and are often devalued by inflation. 
Guan Bo, an associate researcher at a public research institute, said: "This yield is nearly 2 percentage points higher than the risk-free interest rate in the capital market over the same period, and the advantages of concentrated investment in funds are fully demonstrated." 
As of the end of 2017, the total assets of the basic endowment insurance fund amounted to 315.52 billion yuan and the balance of liabilities was 33.62 billion yuan, according to the Social Security Fund. 
Hewlett-Packard is just one of a growing number of companies that have integrated marine plastic waste into their supply chains. 
Hewlett-Packard has announced it will join the NextWave Plastics consortium. The group was founded last year by Dell and the charity Lonely White. 
"Everyone should come forward and contribute to the problem of marine plastic litter," said Ellen Jackowski, Hewlett-Packard's head of global sustainable development strategy and innovation. "The business community should do the same, and I think it's incumbent on the business community to take the lead." 
"A lot of the waste is thrown directly to the ground," she said. "They end up in canals and into the ocean. They can have all sorts of elements, they can be filled with mud, they can be eroded by salty air, they can have a lot of sand. Many of their properties are very different from the plastics you get in the plastic recycling market in the United States." 
"We want to test the whole process thoroughly to make sure that the package is really feasible, not just to see what is possible," said Lena Pripp Kovac, a continuity manager at IKEA Group. 
"They go through all the steps--whether or not the resource is available, whether or not the designer can use it, whether or not it meets our full set of democratic design guidelines. These are the things we want to test." 
"The point of the whole thing is that our society should think of plastics as wealth, not waste, and now everyone thinks they're waste," Jackowski said. "How do we create enough demand for plastics to be seen as wealth, not something we want to throw away?" 
"Plastics is a great material in itself, but we're a bit off course with it. So how do we put the right pieces in the right place in society to create enough value? We need to reuse the material rather than just make new ones." 
The U.S. Holiday shopping season, which starts with Thanksgiving and Black Friday, shows online shopping is gaining traction as more Americans choose to shop on their smartphones at home, while physical store sales and traffic have declined. 
Online sales on Black Friday rose 23.6 per cent from a year earlier to a record $6.22 billion, Adobe Analytics said. The company tracks trading data for 80 of America's top 100 Internet retailers. 
Smartphone end-day sales also topped $2 billion for the first time this year on Black Friday, Adobe Analytics said. 
In addition, on Black Friday this year, consumers bought more high-priced items such as appliances, furniture and larger electronics via mobile phones, with the average order value rising 8.5 percent year-on-year to $146, according to Adobe Analytics. 
Preliminary data from RetailNext, an analytics firm, show that net sales at brick-and-mortar stores fell 4-7% and passenger traffic fell 5-9% between Thanksgiving and Black Friday, continuing a trend seen in recent years. 
Retail research firm ShopperTrak also reported a 1 per cent year-on-year drop in store traffic. 
Faced with a trade war unveiled by President Trump, American farmers are locked out of international markets, hit by retaliatory tariffs and losing lucrative contracts. 
But Mr Trump's $12bn rescue package to make up for farmers' losses has had little impact on mitigating the effects of real-world problems such as red tape and lengthy waiting lists (lack of money). 
Since the first $6 billion was released in September, farmers have received only $838 million, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Another $6 billion is expected to be available next month. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Purdue says the government is unlikely to provide more than $12 billion in additional funding. 
The limitations of the plan began to test the patience of the peasants. The trade war showed no sign of abating, with China and the United States locked in a stalemate that prevented American farmers from accessing key markets for soybeans, agricultural equipment and other products. 
Europe plans to impose more retaliatory tariffs on American peanut butter and orange juice, while Canada and Mexico continue to tax American goods, including pork and cheese. 
Mr Trump, who enjoys support in many agricultural states, still insists that his tough stance on trade will ultimately benefit US farmers. "Farmers are resilient and they can plan ahead because of market conditions," Purdue reiterated last month. 
Volkswagen AG (China) plans to work with partners to invest more than 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in China in 2019 in cutting-edge areas including mobile services, electric vehicles and fast-charging networks. 
Joschan Heizmann, president and chief executive of Volkswagen Motor Group in China, said the German carmaker hoped to accelerate the transformation through sustained and strong investment. 
Heidemann said it would work with joint ventures and new partners in a range of new areas, including technology and mobile services, to provide such services to Chinese customers. 
Volkswagen will launch more than 30 new energy vehicles in China over the next two years, half of which will be made in China, he said. 
The carmaker is expected to deliver about 400,000 new-energy vehicles to the Chinese market by 2020 and to surge to about 1.5 million by 2025. 
Volkswagen's first MEB-based Chinese-made electric vehicles will go into production at two FAW-Volkswagen and SAIC-Volkswagen plants in 2020. 
The company will also work with local partners to explore the establishment of a public quick-charging network for electric vehicles in China starting in 2019. 
Meanwhile, Volkswagen is accelerating the development of autonomous driving technology in China. Its brand, Audi, has qualified for L4 autonomous driving tests in Beijing and Wuxi, in eastern China's Jiangsu province. 
The British royal family faces a "tax nightmare" as US officials investigate whether millions of pounds worth of Megan and Prince Harry are suspected of defaulting on taxes. 
The Duchess of Sussex (Megan) is still a citizen of the United States and must pay taxes in the United States, which could implicate anyone who gives her financial support, including her husband, Prince Harry. 
That would shrink Megan's $5m fortune in the US and Harry's £ 300,000 a year from the trust fund. The trust is Harry's main source of private wealth and pays income tax in the UK. 
Royal aides told the Sunday Express that the inquiry could even involve the Queen and Prince Charles, who provided the Harrys with financial support. The royal family will hire a team of US financial advisers to deal with the issue, the newspaper reported. 
One royal aide said: "We are facing financial risks that the royal family has never faced before." 
The Internal Revenue Service has a reputation for rigorously pursuing U.S. Citizens who it believes are in arrears with taxes. 
Kensington Palace declined a request for comment from the Daily Mail. 
Before the Nazis came to power, Albert Einstein wrote a letter warning of the dangers of rising nationalism and anti-Semitism. The letter was sold for nearly $40,000. 
The previously unknown letter was sold by an anonymous collector in Jerusalem on Tuesday night for $39, 360, Kedem said. 
Albert Einstein wrote to his sister while he was hiding after the assassination of the German Jewish foreign minister by right-wing extremists in 1922. 
Police warned the Jewish scientist that his life might also be in danger. 
"A dark period of economic and political darkness is brewing in Germany, so I'm happy to be able to get out of it," Einstein wrote. 
Kedem auction house said the letter sold for roughly twice its estimated price. 
A rare pink diamond sold at auction for 50.3 million Swiss francs set a record for a single carat. 
The diamond, called "Pink Heritage," weighed almost 19 carats and was bought by Harry Winston, an American diamond brand, at auction in Geneva. 
According to Christie's European headquarters, the diamond set a world record for pink diamonds at about $2.6 million a carat. 
It was priced between $30m and $50m and bought just five minutes after bidding. 
The diamond's new owner renamed it Winston's Pink Heritage. 
Christie's international director of jewelry, Rehur Kadakhia, called the Oppenheimer family diamond, once owned by De Beers Mining, "one of the greatest diamonds in the world." 
"You may have seen less than a carat of pink diamond. But this one is almost 19 carats and it's pink. It's incredible," he said. 
The electric wheelchair used by the late British physicist Stephen Hawking sold for nearly 300,000 pounds ($391,740) at an auction on Thursday, while one of his papers sold for almost twice that price and the proceeds will go to charity. 
Known for exploring the origins of the universe, Hawking spent most of his life in a wheelchair with motor neuron disease. He died in March at the age of 76. 
Some of his personal belongings, including essays, medals, prizes and a "brief history of time" book with his thumbprints on it, were auctioned off online. Also on sale were letters and manuscripts from Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein. 
Hawking's 117-page 1965 paper, "The Properties of Cosmic Expansion," sold for 584,750 pounds, far more than the previous estimate of 150,000 pounds. 
In addition, some of Hawking's medals, originally valued at 15,000 pounds, were sold for 296,750 pounds, while red electric wheelchairs were valued at 15,000 pounds, also valued at 296,750 pounds. 
The nine-day online auction, called "Stand on Giant's Shoulder", was held by Christie's to raise money for the Hawking Foundation and the Motor Neuron Disease Association. 
"Stephen Hawking is very influential around the world and he has a strange ability to connect with people," Thomas Vanning, head of books and manuscripts at Christie's in London, said before the event. 
Last week, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba posted sales of 213.5 billion pounds (£ 24 billion) in 24 hours on the day of the Double 11 retail binge, but the event's annual growth rate fell to an all-time low. 
Online shoppers from China and around the world are preparing to snap up iPhones, furniture and powdered milk before dawn, with sales of more than $10 billion an hour after zero o'clock, according to statistics. 
Singles Day, also known as Double 11, is one of the world's biggest online sales events, with more sales than Black Friday and Internet Monday combined in the United States. 
The Double 11s were originally celebrated by Chinese students as a way to fight Valentine's Day, but gradually evolved into a month-long online shopping festival, culminating at 0 a.m. on the day of the Double 11s. 
It took less than 16 hours for Alibaba to break last year's all-day sales of 168 billion yuan. 
Despite the stunning record, annual sales growth is projected to fall from 39 per cent to 27 per cent, the lowest in a decade. 
Earlier this month, the company expected full-year sales to fall by 4-6 percent, adding to the stock's woes. 
Sales of small appliances and cosmetics were strong on Sunday, while sales of large appliances declined in the home market. Alibaba Vice Chairman Tsai Chung-shin said in an interview. 
"If people hadn't bought a new house, they wouldn't have bought appliances." 
The six-day China International Import Fair closed in Shanghai on Saturday with a cumulative turnover of $57.8 billion, according to the China International Import Expo Bureau. 
High-end smart devices are expected to trade in excess of $16.5 billion, while consumer electronics and appliances are expected to trade in excess of $4.3 billion. 
The estimated trade volume in the auto show area is about $12 billion. 
Sales of clothing and consumer goods were estimated at $3.4 billion, while sales of food and agricultural products were estimated at $12.7 billion. 
Trade in medical devices and healthcare products is expected to total approximately US $5.8 billion, while trade in services is expected to total approximately US $3.2 billion. 
The China International Import Expo Bureau says the total value of agreements reached with countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road proposal is about $4.7bn. 
3617 companies from 151 countries and regions showed their products at the fair. 
Preliminary statistics show that at least 570 new products, technologies or services have been released for the first time in mainland China or around the world. 
Domestic ecommerce giant Alibaba Group set a record for turnover of 213.5 billion yuan during the 24-hour online retail carnival on Sunday. 
Alibaba's platform turnover, which includes Tmall and Taobao, was up about 27 per cent on last year's 168.2bn yuan ($35bn) turnover. 
In just 2 minutes 05 seconds, Tmall website sales exceeded the 10 billion yuan mark, breaking the record of 3 minutes 01 seconds last year. 
The most expensive buyers came from Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou and Guangzhou. 
More than 19,000 overseas brands from 75 countries and regions participated in China's online shopping carnival this year, according to Alibaba. 
Health products are the most popular imported products, milk powder, diapers and skin care products also topped consumers' shopping list. 
Zhang Yong, chief executive of Alibaba Group, said the surge in turnover demonstrated "the continuing pursuit of daily lifestyle upgrades by consumers". 
China has become one of the top 50 economies in terms of business environment as a result of a record number of reforms it implemented last year to improve its business environment, the World Bank Group said in its annual business environment report on Wednesday. 
"China has the highest number of reforms implemented in the East Asia-Pacific region, with its global ranking jumping from 78th last year to 46th this year," the report said. 
"Over the past year, China has made rapid progress in improving the business environment for domestic SMEs, reflecting the importance that the Chinese government attaches to fostering innovation and private enterprises," said Hao Fuman, director of the World Bank's China bureau. 
China's reforms to cut red tape, among other things, put it among the world's top 10 improvements this year, the report said. 
Progress in starting businesses and in accessing electricity has been particularly impressive. 
Since last year, three procedures have been eliminated, so it now takes only nine days to start a business, the same amount as in most OECD high-income countries. 
In terms of power access, it is now completely free in China. Japan and the United Arab Emirates are the only other countries in the world with this feature. 
Despite record results, Apple's shares fell 7% in after-hours trading on Thursday, pushing its market capitalization below the trillion-dollar mark. 
The tech giant's strategy of charging higher prices for its phones has paid off, with revenues rising in the past three months despite relatively stable sales. 
Revenue rose 20 per cent from a year earlier to $62.9bn and total profits rose 31 per cent to $14.1 bn. 
But forecasts of weak sales in the coming months have triggered a fall in its share price after official trading ended. 
The sell-off accelerated after Apple said it would stop disclosing sales. 
Apple executives defended their decision saying the figures were no longer a good indicator of the company's financial health. 
But some analysts caution that outsiders may see this as a sign of disguising shady practices. 
The total number of smartphones sold by all manufacturers worldwide fell for the first time in 2017. But Apple's higher-priced strategy for its phones has helped it ride out the slump. 
The company sold 46.9 million iPhones in the third quarter, up slightly from 46.7 million in the same period last year. 
Companies added 250,000 jobs last month and average wages rose at their fastest pace in nearly a decade to attract and retain workers. 
The Labor Department's monthly employment report, which will be the latest major economic data ahead of the November 6 mid-term elections, also shows unemployment at a five-year low of 3.7 percent. 
New job seekers brought the proportion of Americans working to its highest level since January 2009. 
Consumer confidence is also at its highest level in 18 years, with spending boosting the economy. The U.S. Economy is entering its tenth year of growth, the second longest on record, with a record 100th consecutive month of job growth in October. 
Speaking at the opening of a major trade fair on Monday, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China would take steps to expand market access opportunities. Meanwhile, China has been criticized by other countries for its economic and business practices. 
Xi Jinping said China would reduce tariffs, take more steps to punish intellectual property rights infringements and try to boost domestic consumption of imported goods. 
At the China Import Expo in Shanghai, Xi Jinping promised to "embrace the world" as China, the world's second-largest economy, boosts its growing consumer market. 
He did not name President Trump, but criticized isolationism and the need to defend multilateral trade, alluding to President Trump's "America First" policy. 
The US and China are locked in a trade war, with Mr Trump complaining about the US trade deficit with China and accusing China of intellectual property theft and policies that make it harder for US companies to gain access to the Chinese market. 
Trump announced tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, while China imposed $110 billion in tariffs on U.S. Goods. Xi Jinping and Trump are expected to meet later this month. 
The EU has also complained about China's trade policies, including criticisms that Xi Jinping has failed to honour earlier commitments to reform. Last week, the EU called on Xi Jinping to outline concrete steps to open markets. 
According to the World Bank's 2019 Doing Business Report, China has implemented a record number of reforms to improve the business environment for SMEs over the past year, ranking among the top 10 in the world this year. 
In East Asia and the Pacific, China has implemented the largest number of reforms. As a result, China's global business environment has jumped from 78th place last year to 46th. 
"Over the past year, China has made rapid progress in improving the business environment for its small and medium-sized enterprises," said Hao Fuman, director of the World Bank's China office. "This progress has placed China among the top 50 economies in the world. It also shows that the government attaches great importance to fostering entrepreneurship and private enterprises." 
In what areas, then, has China made significant progress? The World Bank believes that China has made outstanding progress in seven categories of reforms: starting enterprises, obtaining construction permits, obtaining electricity, paying taxes, and cross-border trade. Among them, China has made remarkable progress in the fields of starting enterprises and obtaining electricity. 
In terms of "starting enterprises", China has made it easier to "start enterprises" through the introduction of an online registration system and the simplification of the social security registration process. 
In terms of "access to electricity", China has reduced the power connection time from 143 days to 34 days by expanding its network and providing free power connection services, as well as launching a customer-oriented mobile phone APP. 
China has made significant progress in the areas of "starting enterprises" and "access to electricity". Since last year, three procedures have been eliminated in both areas, and today it only takes nine days to start a business, on par with the average in most OECD high-income countries. In addition, Beijing is one of only two cities in the world where businesses are completely free to start. 
China also offers free access to electricity. Japan and the United Arab Emirates are the only other countries in the world that receive electricity free of charge. 
In the area of "application for construction permits", China has not only made it easier to handle affairs by simplifying the application for construction permits, the completion acceptance process and the registration of real estate for new buildings, but has also imposed stricter qualification requirements on construction professionals and improved public access to information, thereby strengthening building quality control. 
In the area of "registered property", "registered property" is facilitated by simplifying administrative procedures and enhancing the reliability and transparency of land management systems. 
In the protection of minority investors, the protection of minority investors is strengthened by strengthening the rights and role of shareholders in the company's major decisions, clarifying the ownership and control structure, and requiring the reimbursement of legal expenses incurred by shareholders. 
In the area of "taxation", "taxation" is facilitated by eliminating the business tax, allowing for the joint declaration and payment of all stamp duties, and by implementing a number of administrative reforms to shorten the time required for tax compliance. 
With regard to "cross-border trade", the time and costs of "cross-border trade" have been reduced through the implementation of a "single window", the elimination of administrative charges, transparency and competition. 
China has made remarkable progress in almost all areas of "cross-border trade". The cost of border compliance for imports, for example, fell from $745 to $326. 
It takes an average of 496 days to resolve business disputes and costs 16 per cent of the amount claimed, ranking it among the best economies in the world and better than the OECD average of 582 days and 21 per cent, ranking it sixth in the world in terms of costs. (Agencies) 
Despite significant improvements in China's business environment over the past year, there is still much room for improvement in the "construction permit" sector (121st). In China, companies need to complete 20 procedures to build a warehouse for all licences and authorizations, compared with an average of 15 in East Asia and the Pacific. However, as a result of the latest progress in the construction quality control index, China's performance has come close to the OECD standards set for high-income economies, scoring 11 out of 15 out of the full score. 
"We're going to be very cautious about marijuana," Johnston said in an interview. 
"But at the moment I can't disclose any of our plans in this area." 
But he said the company would "spare no effort to find growth." 
"To be fair, we're looking at opportunities, but we don't have any plans right now," Johnston said. 
Pepsi shares fell 1.7 percent to $108.88 at 9:04 a.m. New York time. 
Cannabis drinks are not focused on THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, which Coca-Cola is not interested in, and research has focused on cannabis diol, which is already widely used in health products. Bloomberg says the drink will help relieve inflammation, pain and cramps. 
Cannabis beverages are seen as potential growth areas for carbonated drinks and spirits companies, which are experiencing bottlenecks in product sales. 
Canada will legalize cannabis on Octobe 17 after two house of parliament voted to use it for recreational purposes. 
The rich are getting richer and more numerous. 
According to an annual survey by UBS and PricewaterhouseCoopers, 332 new billionaires were added globally last year, with their accumulated wealth rising 19 per cent to a record $8.9tn. 
What is behind this phenomenon? It's China's explosive wealth creation. 
There were only 16 billionaires in China in 2006. But China had 373 billionaires in 2017, a fifth of the world's billionaires. 
The United States remains the region with the largest number of billionaires, with 585, but the pace of wealth creation in the region is slowing. 
There were 53 new billionaires in 2017 and 87 new billionaires in 2012. 
In China, 106 new billionaires were added in 2017, equivalent to an average of one new billionaire every three days. 
The renminbi fell to a 10-year low against the dollar on Monday, close to a politically sensitive one-to-seven ratio. 
The renminbi fell to 6.9644 against the dollar in midday trading, below its last low in 2016, before recovering slightly. But this is the lowest level since May 2008. 
A weak renminbi is one of a series of factors leading to Washington's dissatisfaction with Beijing's trade policy. The US Treasury did not name China a currency manipulator this month, but said it was watching Beijing closely. 
China's tariff war with the Trump administration came amid a pledge to avoid a "competitive devaluation" of the renminbi to boost exports. But China is trying to make its state-controlled exchange rate more responsive to markets, which are pushing the yuan lower. 
While the dollar has little economic significance against the renminbi at a ratio of 1 to 7, it could revive US concerns about the exchange rate. 
Mizuho Bank said in a report on Monday that Chinese authorities might "hold their ground" to prevent "a 7-to-1 exchange rate loss". 
The renminbi has fallen nearly 10 per cent against the dollar since April as interest rates in the US and China have moved in the opposite direction as the Chinese economy has cooled. That would help exporters to impose 25 per cent tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods by the Trump administration. But that increases the risk that the US will complain about Beijing's trade strategy. 
China failed to meet the criteria for being classified as a currency manipulator, but said beijing, along with japan and germany, was on the government's list of closely watched monetary policies, a us treasury report said on october 17th. Once classified as a currency manipulator, sanctions may be imposed. 
A weaker yuan could also fuel capital outflows from the world's second-largest economy. That will lead to higher borrowing costs as China's leaders try to shore up an economy that has seen cooling off. 
The People's Bank of China has been trying to improve the efficiency of its exchange rate mechanism by increasing the role of the market. 
The renminbi exchange rate is set every morning and cannot fluctuate more than 2 per cent against the dollar on the same day. The central bank can buy or sell renminbi, or order China's commercial banks to do so, to curb price changes. 
Some forecasters say Beijing's position could change if President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping make no progress during the G20 summit in November.
