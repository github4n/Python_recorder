This is an undergraduate parking lot. As I was looking for a parking space, a blond undergraduate roared past in a shiny white Cadillac down the slope. 

My dream is for the audience to take the lead and tell their own version of the story by making their own decisions. 

Because you can already think from their point of view. 

For laymen, the premise of a formal debate is straightforward: there is a big issue on the table--we support civil disobedience, for example, and we favour free trade--with one group supporting the idea and another opposing it. 

You prescribe antibiotics to a patient you suspect has a bacterial infection, and you don't really need to know more about the bacteria that cause the disease, and many of the patients are cured. 

I spent 20 years trying to find a way to do that. 

It is that humility that makes us better decision makers. 

Through casual encounters with classmates, often on the Internet, I learned that living in a big house in a wealthy neighborhood is very common. 

Therefore, as we develop more and more antibiotics, new antibiotics will immediately become the first choice to treat bacterial infections. 

My first debate took place in the Auditorium of Canberra Grammar School for Girls, and I made all the terrible mistakes you can see on cable news. 

Today, I want to tell you about this new way of telling stories, a way that is "interactive" at its core. 

Many of my classmates bought new luxury cars just to get to school, and there were fancy apartments for parties at school. But those are only material things. 

Mark Rialy, a neuroscientist and psychologist at Duke University, and his colleagues found that those who were able to do this--a skill--were what researchers call fools, With the ability to evaluate diverse evidence extensively, they will also be more objective in their assessment and less defensive in the face of conflicting evidence. 

Incidentally, antibiotics have made a great contribution to the prolongation of our life span. 

I thought attacking an argument was much simpler than attacking the essence of the argument. 

So, I brought an interactive scenario that we could all participate in. 

What really surprised me was their attitude towards everyday expenses. 

These are all the virtues that we want our bosses, colleagues, partners, and decision makers to have, all the virtues that we want ourselves to have. 

It was a terrible feeling when the same person challenged me again, and I felt humiliated and humiliated. 

Today, we are able to perform complex medical interventions and surgeries because we have antibiotics, so we no longer risk dying the day after surgery from bacterial infections. 

I'll invite Vicky--hello, Vicky--to play the lead role for us. 

Then I realized how naive I was. 

So when we embrace this uncertain modesty, all of us should ask each other this question. 

Therefore, we began to forget the existence of bacteriophages, especially in Western medicine. 

Although I bravely walked into the world of debate, I began to be fascinated. 

And your characters--as spectators--are going to make a choice. 

One of my classmates took part in the MBA program under the auspices of scholarships and grants. 

There is a precedent. 

I saw that possibility, and I worked hard for many years and mastered good debate skills. 

More precisely, even as I grew up, the notion was that we had solved the problem of bacterial infections; Because we have antibiotics. 

Neither Vicky nor I know what will happen next, because what will happen next is entirely up to you. 

He has no money. Although his tuition was waived, he still had to pay for his own daily expenses. 

In 1969, the famous American children's TV presenter, Mr. Rogers, sat before the Congressional Communications Subcommittee, chaired by John Pastor, who looked particularly grumpy. 

I can see you didn't even know there was one. 

Of course, as we all know today, this idea is grossly wrong. 

Okay, now we have to make the first choice. 

He lives in a shabby neighborhood rather than a luxurious high-rise apartment or a comfortable downtown apartment, close to school. 

Mr. Rogers is here to make a classic debate, a very bold proposal: to increase federal funding for public television broadcasts. 

(Laughter) 

Now, most people have heard of superbugs. 

There is a fish on the ground. What shall we do? Should we save it or ignore it? Remember, we don't have much time, so we'd better hurry. 

I live nearby and can hear the sound of police patrols and shootings in his neighborhood. 

At first, Senator Pastor of the Disciplinary Committee did not approve it. 

This is achieved by discriminating between views and identities and by being sincerely open to persuasion. 

It's a bacterium that is resistant to many, if not all, of the antibiotics we have developed to treat bacterial infections. 

What are we gonna do? 

I don't live in a big place, but at least it's safe. He sleeps on a sofa in a public room, halfway between the gang and the drug business. 

It almost became a poor ending for Mr. Rogers. 

Through debate, you can organize a dialogue about what the world is, what it might be, and what it should be. 

Audience: Save it! 

How did all this happen? In fact, we are not as clever as we think. 

Tap water is available sometimes, but it's cheap, hundreds of dollars a month. 

But with patience and reason, Mr Rogers explains why high-quality children's programmes, television shows about anecdotes that appear in most ordinary homes, are crucial to all of us. 

David Cage: Well, save the fish, right? 

Antibiotics have been used everywhere since we started-in hospitals for treatment and prevention; Deal with a small cold at home; On farms, bacteria evolved to keep animals healthy. 

Or to put it another way, I'd be happy to share my own experience, a proven mentoring program to teach you to talk politics with your cousins at the next family dinner; The way to reorganize your team to discuss the new proposal; Think about how we can change the way we communicate in public. 

Apparently, he doesn't have a car and usually walks to where he wants to go. He doesn't have many friends because he can't afford to go out with anyone. When we go out, I have to make sure we don't have to spend any money. 

Even if it costs money. 

(Video) (Fish flaps). 

Surviving bacteria are the most resilient under the siege of antibiotics. 

So let's start by finding an entry point: Debates require us to be straightforward and polite, face to face with conflicting views. 

He can't even afford food, so he takes a part-time job in the college food service department to earn money and eats the leftover food. 

He took us to the level of shared reality. 

David Cage: The fish is saved. 

Today, we call it "multidrug-resistant bacteria." 

The basis of the debate is rebuttal. 

When people eat at popular spots in Beverly Hills and Hollywood, he scrapes through the leftovers from the pot. 

On the other side of the debate, Senator Pastor listened and thought. 

Looks like our robots like animals. 

It's when you make an argument and I respond, and then you respond to my response. 

In a recent study commissioned by the British Government, it is estimated that up to 2050, about 10 million people will die each year from multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. 

However, he never complains about our classmates wasting money. 

Need more people with debate and persuasion skills. 

So, let's move on. 

If there is no rebuttal, it is not a debate, it can only be called self-talk. 

He understands his worth and is focused on his goals. 

Compared with the eight million people who currently die of cancer each year, this number is clearly terrible. 

Don't forget, we have a hostage situation to deal with. 

But on the other side of the debate table we also need a lot more people like Senator Pastor. 

I first imagined that the most successful debaters, the best lobbyists, must be particularly good at going to extremes. 

The good news, though, is that phages are not far off. 

(Video) Woman: Please, please, please save my daughter! Wait--you sent a robot? 

He made me feel like a spoiled child, free to spend money and buy myself pancakes whenever I felt hungry. 

The magic of debate is that it empowers you to be Mr. Rogers and Senator Pastor at the same time. 

They must have some magical ability to make extreme views acceptable. 

And, I have to tell you, they don't care about multidrug resistance. 

Officer: Well, ma'am, you should go. 

Let them explain to me and everyone else how they can change their minds. 

So how ridiculous I looked at first when I was sad about my relatively poor finances. He showed real determination and pride in his embarrassed life. 

It took me a long time to figure it out, but the opposite is true. 

(Laughter) 

Woman: You can't do that! Why not send a real person? 

It's all a matter of attitude, not practice. 

And even MBAs have different attitudes towards spending money. 

The most productive dissenters usually start by finding common ground, no matter how small. 

David Cage: Well, this lady is upset. 

Once you start to think about what will make you change your mind, you start to wonder why you were so sure in the first place. 

They just like to hunt the bacteria around us. 

Her daughter was taken hostage by a robot and, of course, she was in a state of shock. 

There are many debates in practice that teach us how to argue effectively. 

Moreover, they remain selective and remain a good thing today. 

Now, we can continue to scout the apartment. 

Perhaps this is the best news: bacteriophages are no longer invisible microorganisms. 

We should bring these methods to work, to meetings, and to our city council. 

As you can see, all SWAT units are in position. 

We can sequence their genes and understand how they replicate. 

The principle of debate can change the way we communicate with each other. It can make us stop talking and start listening. 

We also understand their limitations. 

Stop refusing and start persuading. 

Stop sealing yourself off and start opening your mind. 

We are in the midst of a new era in the development of powerful and reliable phage-based drugs. 

My unscrupulous spending classmates found six-figure-a-year jobs through the power of the Internet after graduation and quickly paid off huge student loans. 

They first find out what we all agree on, and then start with that: the right to education, equality for all, and the importance of a safer community. 

Thank you very much, everyone. 

(Applause.) 

The challenges each turtle faces in its lifetime include: First, the mother lays a nest of leather in a nest dug high on the beach, and about 20% of the 50-200 eggs in a nest don't hatch 

Action is already under way around the world. 

But in the meantime, my poor friend is still trying to make money. 

They are taking us to what psychologists call "shared reality". 

King Pygmalion of Cyprus is a famous sculptor. 

So, I'm sure we're on the verge of a revival in bacteriophage therapy. 

The eggs that survive a month and a half later hatch into baby turtles, each smaller than the palm of your hand. Each new group climbs up to the surface and begins to rush violently all the way to the ocean, where debris, holes, crabs, gulls, raccoons and other threats take away about 50 percent of them. 

And shared reality is the antidote to alternative facts. 

He portrayed such a lovely ivory maiden that he fell in love with it. 

In my opinion, the correct way to draw a bacteriophage should be like this. 

Of course, conflicts persist. 

The only predators he's worried about are some of the larger sharks: bull sharks, tiger sharks, great white sharks and occasional killer whales 

I'm a robot from Digital Life. 

(Laughter) 

Every day he clothed Galati with gold and purple robes. Galati was the name he gave his sweetheart. 

That's why it's called a debate. 

Now, let's take a quick look at the chances of a turtle surviving its lifetime 

(Video) Connor: Has it been emotionally stimulated lately? 

In my opinion, bacteriophages are the superheroes we've been waiting for in the battle against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. 

Shared reality gives us a platform to talk about it. 

He hugged it and kissed it, but it was still a statue. 

So adult turtles are the personification of a series of impossible events 

Captain: I don't know. 

Thank you, everyone. 

But the trick in debate is that you end up talking directly, face-to-face, on the table. 

Desperate, he came to Aphrodite's temple for help. 

What's on your mind? It's a disease? Or fear? Probably a very unpleasant feeling. 

What does this have to do with kidnapping? 

(Applause.) 

The findings also prove critical. 

He offered abundant sacrifices and prayed affectionately to the goddess to give him a wife who behaved as gracefully as Galati. 

However, the impact of the virus is not always negative. 

Connor: I need more information to determine the best [rescue] plan. 

That's what I said to the visitors to the Lacrosse Public Library. 

Research by Professor Juliana Schroeder and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, shows that listening to people's voices is a human process when they make controversial points. 

When he got home, he went straight to the statue. 

The woman suffered a knee injury and required multiple operations, during which she developed chronic bacterial infections in her legs. 

David Cage: Well, here's the second option. 

That's exactly what I thought. 

This will make it easier for you to understand what the other person is going to say. 

As he gazed at it, the statue began to change. 

Unfortunately, all the antibiotics of the time didn't work on the bacteria that caused her infection. 

Maybe we can learn something. 

The children who come to our library are my friends because I care about their needs and future. 

So now please stay away from the keyboard and start communicating with others. 

His cheeks began to look faint, his eyes shone, his lips gently opened, and he smiled sweetly. 

I was fascinated by the strange idea that viruses could cure bacterial infections. 

What should we choose? 

I want them to be happy and successful. 

If we expand on this, nothing prevents us from pressing the pause button in a polite panel discussion in a series of keynote speeches and replacing them with a well-structured debate. 

To this day, I'm still fascinated by the medical potential of bacteriophages. 

Pygmalion stood speechless as Galati approached him. She is simple, gentle, full of energy! 

Audience: Behavior. 

I hope they can find good books and make them happy with the movies. 

All of our meetings can deliberately debate the largest and most controversial points in the field. 

Soon her sweet silver bell rang in the room. His sculpture became his wife. 

So I quit my job last year and started a company in this field. 

Captain: Listen, saving that child is the most important thing. 

Or a solution to a problem. 

We can devote ten minutes of our weekly group meeting to debating a proposal to change the way the team works. 

(Laughter) 

Suppose you're on the beach and the sand gets in your eyes. How do you know there's sand? 

David Cage: Well, I don't think I can get much from this guy. 

Often libraries have a good reputation for actually working for the well-being of the community. 

(Laughter) 

What are they doing in your hands? 

Obviously you can't see it, but if you're a normal, healthy person, you can feel a very uncomfortable feeling of sand called "pain." 

Daniel: Hello! 

We are committed to connecting communities and the wider world, says our mission and goals statement. 

Once we enter the realm of shared reality, the debate also demands that we separate ideas from the identity of the proponents. 

(Laughter) 

The pain requires you to take action. In this case, you wash your eyes until the sand disappears. How do you know the sand is gone? 

Girl: You're my best friend and we'll always be together! 

We rally the minds of the masses and we create lifelong learners. 

So in a formal debate, only controversial things can be discussed: we should raise the voters' age and ban illegal gambling, for example. 

Like our bodies, your hands are a hotbed of bacterial activity and an ideal hunting ground for bacteriophages, which eventually kill bacteria. 

I wanted to give my daughter and the next generation a better, cleaner environment, so not only did I stop shopping too much, but I also recycled the returned goods with all my heart. 

David Cage: It's just a play on the scene. There are a lot of other plays. 

These visions are important to libraries because we know that they have the power to create a better world. 

But the debaters did not choose their position. 

The phage is hunted with its feet, which are super-sensitive sensory organs used to accurately detect the surface of bacterial cells. 

Depending on the choices you make, we'll see many different moves, many different results, many different endings. 

A world in which people are more connected, engaged, and compassionate. 

Before we fill our shopping carts and dumpsters with unwanted items, let's stop for the next time and think about what we really want: a beautiful planet that can be called home. 

That's why that 10-year-old Julia did something meaningless. 

So you can see what my job as an interactive writer is. 

Thank you. 

Books have power, information has power. 

Once the bacteriophage detects the bacterial surface, it locks onto the bacterial cell wall and injects its own DNA into the bacterium. 

Attacks on the identity of those involved in the dispute are irrelevant to the debate, as they do not have the right to choose their own position. 

(Applause.) 

Connecting with vulnerable groups in the community is particularly important. 

DNA, located on the head of a bacteriophage, enters the bacterium through its long body. 

A linear writer only needs to think about time and space, and as an interactive writer I have to think about time, space, and all sorts of other possibilities. 

Your only strategy for winning is to go head-to-head with the best, clearest, and most objective viewpoints. 

(cello music) 

A study published in 1995 by Betty Hart and Todd Leslie showed what we now call the "30 million word gap" between working-class families and families receiving social welfare benefits. 

I have to deal with the plot in a number of branch structures, each of which is a new variable in the story. 

At this point, the bacteriophage will re-code the bacteria to produce a large number of new phages. 

This may sound a little unrealistic, or childish, to imagine that you could get that idea out of a high school auditorium. 

(End of music) 

In fact, bacteria have become bacteriophage factories. 

I need to think about all the possibilities in a particular scenario and try to imagine everything that might happen. 

Essentially, they found that children from these families heard much less vocabulary each day, so by the time they were three years old, this huge gap in language mastery appeared. 

We spend too much time refuting the views of Democrats or Republicans. 

On the flight here, I thought of my mother. 

Once about 50-100 bacteriophages have accumulated in the bacterium, they release a protein that destroys the bacterial cell wall. 

I have to deal with tens of thousands of variables, situations and possibilities, and as a result, a screenplay only takes about 100 pages, whereas an interactive screenplay like this one takes between 4,000 and 5,000 pages. 

Vocabulary gap will accompany them into school, resulting in the development of reading ability lag behind, and reading level is poor, and on the whole it is difficult to achieve anything. 

I'm a self-taught cello player and I've never been professionally trained. 

He refuse that offer simply because it was from headquarter, or because it came from a place we thought was different from ours. 

When the bacteria break down, the phage runs out and continues to search for new bacteria to infect. 

That's what I'm going to tell you about my job. 

Children need to hear different words every day, and not just in our daily conversations. They also need to hear strange words. There are about 10,000 words that we don't use very often. 

But it's possible. 

I learned the bass, but I prefer to play the cello because I prefer the cello. 

I'm sorry, but this may sound like another terrible virus. 

Next, I'll read you a children's essay by one of the most popular children's writers, Eric Carr. 

But I think ultimately the experience will be very unique because it's a collaborative effort, done by the writer who creates the narrative scene and the player who makes the decision, who tells his own story and becomes the co-creator, co-actor and co-director of the story. 

When I work with a team to come up with a new idea or solve an extremely complex problem, I ask all of them to submit their views anonymously. 

But my mother inspired me. 

But that's what phages have--the ability to breed inside bacteria and then kill them--which makes them interesting from a medical point of view. 

"Finally, the sloth replied," I am really slow and quiet and bored, I am lazy, I am dawdling and ink stains. I am also unhurried, listless, very calm, indifferent, slow, drowsy, calm, calm, peaceful, idle, and dull! I am very relaxed, very peaceful, and I like to live in peace. But I'm not lazy. 'Then the sloth yawned,' That's me. I like to do things slowly, slowly, slowly. '" 

I firmly believe that over the next few years we will also see a growing number of moving and meaningful interactive experiences created by a new generation of people. 

For example, two years ago, I was working with a number of government departments to consider new solutions to the problem of long-term unemployment. 

But I didn't realize it at first because my mother earned her music degree by mail-ordering courses from the American Conservatory of Music. 

Another area of great interest to me is the scale of the development. 

You can see from this simple example in the library how Karl uses 20 different words to convey the same meaning to his children. 

It's a medium waiting for Orson Wells or Stanley Kubrick to emerge, and I believe they will soon emerge as masters of the new era. 

It is also one of the most difficult, tricky, and well-researched public policy issues. 

While raising her two children, she takes classes once a week through her e-mail and practices them. 

Just five years ago, I didn't know anything about bacteriophages; Today, however, I will tell you that they are part of the laws of nature. 

Now we know that many families come to the library, and many of them are in financial difficulties. 

I believe that interactive storytelling will be the new face of 20th-century cinema: a profoundly transformative art! 

A few years later, she gave her own recital. 

As I said before, at the beginning, possible solutions were gathered from everywhere. 

Some scientists even estimate that bacteriophages may be the most abundant living organisms on earth. 

Thank you! 

We know of a friend named James who came by after class and lived in a local shelter. His reading was not up to grade level and probably never had it. 

We gather them together, and each scenario is presented in the same template. 

I turned 50 this month and it took me a long time to realize that she was a source of inspiration and motivation. 

So before we move on to their medical potential, I think everyone needs to know about phages and their role on Earth: they search for, infect, and kill bacteria. 

(Applause.) 

We know that there is a "30 million vocabulary gap" and that when children enter third grade, there is a corresponding gap in their performance, both of which are directly related to income levels. 

I'll always--thank you, mom. 

At this point, they all look the same, no obvious difference. 

Then, how could there be such a perfectly functioning creature in nature, ubiquitous, always with us; But in most parts of the world, in our pharmaceutical market, is there no drug that can use this mechanism to fight bacterial infections? The answer is simple: no one has invented the drug yet, or at least no such drug that meets Western regulatory guidelines that set standards for most things in the world. To find out why, go back a bit. 

Sometimes I feel that the only thing we can agree on is that we can't agree on anything. 

(Applause.) 

So what role can libraries play in bridging this gap? How can we help our friends become more successful, more educated and, one day, better global citizens? The first thing to do is to make sure that they have free and equal access to the resources in the library. 

Then, of course, they are singled out for discussion, refinement, and final approval. 

But when he discovered the bacteriophage in 1917, he knew nothing about his discovery. 

The public discussion has been a mess. 

In addition to being an outstanding musician, my mother is one of the most extraordinary people I know. 

Books create a level playing field by exposing children in different socio-economic environments to text. 

At the end of the process, more than two dozen new ideas were presented to cabinet ministers responsible for decision-making. 

At the time, he was interested in a disease called bacillary dysentery, a severe form of diarrhea caused by bacterial infections that had a high mortality rate in those days, when there were no drugs available to treat bacterial infections. 

We find scenes where TV debaters yell at each other, we surf the Internet for communities, try to connect with others, and often go offline in a sense of anger and isolation. 

I'd like to play a passage for my mother, and for your mothers as well. 

We have five projects in the library for children based on early literacy: play, sing, speak, read, and write. 

But more than half of them were created by people who couldn't even speak to policy advisers. 

He took the sample and filtered it until he was sure that only tiny organisms were left in the sample. Then he took a drop from it and dropped it into the newly-cultured bacteria. 

In our daily lives, we may become too scared to argue because others are shouting, and we don't want to get involved at all. 

(cello music) 

We offer computer courses and vocational skills training programs for adults, entrepreneurship programs. 

Or people whose views have never been taken seriously because of their humble status. 

Contempt replaces communication. 

He observed that in the next few hours all the bacteria were killed. 

(End of music) 

We provide all these services to members of the community, and we balance our payments by charging fines and fees to our customers. 

Those who answered the phone, assistants who managed the calendar, representatives from organizations that were not always trusted. 

My mission in life is to help people effectively disagree. 

So he came to two conclusions. 

Usually when you hear the cello, you think of this. 

Today, in La Crosse, 10,000 users are unable to access library materials because of unpaid fines and fees. 

Think about what would have happened if our news media had done the same thing. 

Find a way to uncover the truth and give new insights into life. 

(Laughter and applause) 

First and foremost, the most obvious conclusion is that yes, something is killing bacteria, and it's in those liquids. 

If we look at the poorest communities, where 82 per cent of students are considered economically disadvantaged, that figure rises to 23 per cent of the community population. 

The scene was almost impressive--there was an important policy proposal on the table during this week's cable news session, and it wasn't clear whether it was from a liberal or a conservative party. 

(Drums) (Cello) 

Another conclusion is that it must be biological in nature, because one drop is enough to make such a big difference. 

I think-or I hope-there will be a well-structured pattern of argument, a sincere position of mutual respect with a desire to persuade or be persuaded. 

Although these are local data, they also apply to the country as a whole. 

Hey! 

Or a series of pros and cons to an idea, will not tell you where its author works. 

To make this clear, let me take you back to the past. 

He called the reagent "invisible microorganisms" and named it "bacteriophages," literally "bacteriophagers." 

The poorest communities are the largest fined libraries in the country, with the largest number of people barred from using their resources. 

(Circular sample of stage sound) 

Our public discourse, and even our personal dissent, can be transformed by debating points of view rather than identity positions. 

When I was 10 years old, I loved to argue with people. 

Today, two scientists who study bacteriophages and develop bacteriophage-based drugs receive the Nobel Prize in chemistry. 

In fact, the Colorado State Library is worried about this, publishing a white paper and making it clear that it is the fines that deter the poor. 

(Cello Music and Ring Samples) 

As human beings, debate also allows us to truly open our minds to the possibility that we have made mistakes. 

For me, it's an attractive possibility that you can persuade others to accept your point of view by the power of words alone. 

A colleague of mine called a car from Lyft in Atlanta last year, where he talked to the driver about libraries, just like us. 

(End of music) 

Humility to uncertainty. 

Perhaps surprisingly, neither my parents nor my teachers like to argue. 

The driver told him that she had enjoyed going to the local library regularly since she was a child. 

(Applause and cheers) 

One of the reasons why it is difficult to argue effectively is that we often cling to our opinions. 

(Laughter) 

Since Aristotle defined the rules of tragedy about 2,500 years ago, the way we tell stories has naturally changed. 

We start to think that we have them, and stretch out, that they have us. 

Just as they thought it would be good for four-year-old Julia to burn some energy through gymnastics, they thought it might be good for me to join the debate team. 

He believes that storytelling is to reproduce the scene in life, so that our emotions are touched. 

But in the end, if you argue long enough, your position will change, and you will keep shifting in the debate about expanding the welfare of your country. 

Meaning, go argue where they're not. 

But in a play, novel, or film, the author has made all the decisions for the character in advance, and as an audience, we can only passively witness the outcome of the author's decisions. 

But also for or against compulsory voting. 

This kind of training can upset your cognitive transition. 

I entered the student parking lot, you can see all of the new car, many of whom are luxury car brand.
