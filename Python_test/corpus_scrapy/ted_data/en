Say you're at the beach,and you get sand in your eyes.How do you know the sand is there?You obviously can't see it,but if you are a normal, healthy human,you can feel it,that sensation of extreme discomfort,also known as pain.Now, pain makes you do something,in this case, rinse your eyesuntil the sand is gone.And how do you know the sand is gone?Exactly. Because there's no more pain.There are people who don't feel pain.Now, that might sound cool, but it's not.If you can't feel pain, you couldget hurt, or even hurt yourselfand never know it.Pain is your body's early warning system.It protects you from the worldaround you, and from yourself.As we grow, we install pain detectorsin most areas of our body.These detectorsare specialized nerve cellscalled nociceptorsthat stretch from your spinal cordto your skin, your muscles, your joints,your teeth and someof your internal organs.Just like all nerve cells,they conduct electrical signals,sending information from whereverthey're located back to your brain.But, unlike other nerve cells,nociceptors only fire if somethinghappens that could causeor is causing damage.So, gently touch the tip of a needle.You'll feel the metal,and those are your regular nerve cells.But you won't feel any pain.Now, the harder you pushagainst the needle,the closer you getto the nociceptor threshold.Push hard enough,and you'll cross that thresholdand the nociceptors fire,telling your body to stop doingwhatever you're doing.But the pain threshold isn't set in stone.Certain chemicals can tune nociceptors,lowering their threshold for pain.When cells are damaged,they and other nearby cellsstart producing these tuningchemicals like crazy,lowering the nociceptors'threshold to the pointwhere just touch can cause pain.And this is where over-the-counterpainkillers come in.Aspirin and ibuprofenblock production of one classof these tuning chemicals,called prostaglandins.Let's take a look at how they do that.When cells are damaged, they releasea chemical called arachidonic acid.And two enzymes called COX-1 and COX-2convert this arachidonic acidinto prostaglandin H2,which is then convertedinto a bunch of other chemicalsthat do a bunch of things,including raise your body temperature,cause inflammationand lower the pain threshold.Now, all enzymes have an active site.That's the place in the enzymewhere the reaction happens.The active sites of COX-1 and COX-2fit arachidonic acid very cozily.As you can see, there is no room to spare.Now, it's in this active sitethat aspirin and ibuprofen do their work.So, they work differently.Aspirin acts like a spinefrom a porcupine.It enters the active siteand then breaks off,leaving half of itself in there,totally blocking that channeland making it impossiblefor the arachidonic acid to fit.This permanently deactivatesCOX-1 and COX-2.Ibuprofen, on the other hand,enters the active site,but doesn't break apartor change the enzyme.COX-1 and COX-2 are freeto spit it out again,but for the timethat that ibuprofen is in there,the enzyme can't bind arachidonic acid,and can't do its normal chemistry.But how do aspirin and ibuprofenknow where the pain is?Well, they don't.Once the drugs are in your bloodstream,they are carried throughout your body,and they go to painful areasjust the same as normal ones.So that's how aspirin and ibuprofen work.But there are other dimensions to pain.Neuropathic pain, for example,is pain caused by damageto our nervous system itself;there doesn't need to beany sort of outside stimulus.And scientists are discoveringthat the brain controlshow we respond to pain signals.For example, how much painyou feel can depend onwhether you're paying attentionto the pain, or even your mood.Pain is an area of active research.If we can understand it better, maybewe can help people manage it better.
Hi. My name is Aparna.I am a shopaholic —
(Laughter)
and I'm addicted to online returns.
(Laughter)
Well, at least I was.At one time, I had two or threepackages of clothing delivered to meevery other day.I would intentionally buy the same itemin a couple different sizesand many colors,because I did not knowwhat I really wanted.So I overordered, I tried things on,and then I sent what didn't work back.Once my daughter was watching mereturn some of those packages back,and she said, "Mom,I think you have a problem."
(Laughter)
I didn't think so.I mean, it's free shippingand free returns, right?
(Laughter)
I didn't even think twice about it,until I heard a statisticat work that shocked me.
You see, I'm a global solutionsdirector for top-tier retail,and we were in a meetingwith one of my largest customers,discussing how to streamline costs.One of their biggest concernswas managing returns.Just this past holiday season alone,they had 7.5 million piecesof clothing returned to them.
I could not stop thinking about it.What happens to allthese returned clothes?So I came home and researched.And I learned that every year,four billion pounds of returned clothingends up in the landfill.That's like every resident in the USdid a load of laundry last nightand decided to throw itin the trash today.
I was horrified.I'm like, "Of all people,I should be able to help prevent this."
(Laughter)
My job is to find solutionsto logistical issues like these —not create them.So this issue became very personal to me.I said, "You know what?We have to solve this."And we can, with some of the existingsystems we already have in place.
And then I started to wonder:How did we get here?I mean, it was only like six years agowhen a study recommendedthat offering free online returnswould drive customers to spend more.We started seeing companiesoffering free online returnsto drive more salesand provide a better experience.What we didn't realizeis that this would lead to more itemsbeing returned as well.In the US, companies lost351 billion dollars in salesin 2017 alone.Retailers are scramblingto recover their losses.They try to place that returned itemonline to be sold again,or they'll sell it to a discount partneror a liquidator.Basically, if companies cannot finda place for this itemquickly and economically,its place becomes the trash.
Suddenly, I felt very guiltyfor being that shopper,somebody who contributes to this.Who would have thoughtmy innocent shopping behaviorwould be hurting not only me,but our planet as well?
And as I thought about what to do,I kept thinking:Why does the item have to be returnedto the retailer in the first place?What if there was another way,a win-win for everyone?What if when a personis trying to return something,it could go to the nextshopper who wants it,and not the retailer?What if, instead of a return,they could do what I call a "green turn"?Consumers could use an appto take pictures of the itemand verify the conditionwhile returning it.Artificial intelligence systems could thensort these clothes by condition —mint condition or slightly used —and direct it to the nextappropriate person.Mint-conditioned clothes couldautomatically go to the next buyer,while slightly used clothescould be marked downand offered online again.The retailer can decide the business ruleson the number of timesa particular item can be resold.All that the consumer would need to dois obtain a mobile code,take it to the nearest shipping placeto be packed and shipped,and off it goes fromone buyer to the next,not the landfill.
Now you will ask,"Would people reallygo through all this trouble?"I think they would if they had incentives,like loyalty points or cash back.Let's call it "green cash."There would be a wholenew opportunity to make moneyfrom this new customer baselooking to buy these returns.This system would makea fun thing like shoppinga spiritual experiencethat helps save our planet.
(Applause)
This is doableand would probably take six monthsto weave some of our existing systemsand run a pilot.Even before any of theselogistical systems are in place,each of us shoppers can act now,if every single adult in the USmade a few small changesto our shopping behavior.Take the extra timeto research and think —Do I really need this item?No: Do I really want this item? —before making a purchase.And if every one of us adults in the USreturned five less items this year,we would keep 240 million poundsof clothes out of the landfill.Six percent reduction, just like that.This environmental problemthat we have createdis not thousands of years away;it's happening today,and must stop now to prevent growinglandfills across the globe.
I want to leave my daughterand my daughter's daughtera better and cleaner placethan I found it,so I have not only stopped overordering,I recycle religiously as well.And you can, too. It's not difficult.Before we fill our shopping cartsand our landfillswith extra items that we don't want,let's pause next timewe are shopping onlineand think twice about what we allhopefully really do want:a beautiful Earth to call home.
Thank you.
(Applause)

On the flight here,I was reminded about my mom.I'm a self-taught cellist,I've never had a lesson.I studied double bass, but I justpicked up the cello and started playingbecause I love doing it.But my mom was an inspiration to me.I did not realize she was an inspiration,because she got her music degreethrough a mail-order course,the US School of Music.While raising two kids,she received a lesson a week in the mail,and practiced.And at the end of a couple of years,she put on a recital.And I'll be 50 this month,and it took me that long to realizethat she was that big of an inspiration.I'm just going to keep —yeah, thanks, mom.
(Applause)
She's also one of the mostextraordinary people I know,beyond being a wonderful musician.I want to play a little bit for momand your moms as well, actually.

The way we tell storieshas naturally changedsince Aristotle definedthe rules of tragedyabout 2,500 years ago.According to him,the role of storytelling is to mimic lifeand make us feel emotions.And that's exactly whatstorytelling as we know ithas done very well since then.But there is a dimension of lifethat storytelling couldnever really reproduce.It is the notion of choices.
Choices are a veryimportant part of our lives.We as individuals are definedby the choices we make.Some of our decisions can havevery significant consequencesand totally changethe courses of our lives.But in a play, a novel or a film,the writer makes all the decisionsin advance for the characters,and as the audience,we can only watch, passively,the consequences of his decisions.
As a storyteller,I've always been fascinatedwith the idea of recreatingthis notion of choices in fiction.My dream was to put the audiencein the shoes of the main protagonists,let them make their own decisions,and by doing so,let them tell their own stories.Finding a way to achieve this is whatI did in the past 20 years of my life.
Today, I would like to introduce youto this new way of telling stories,a way that has interactivity at its heart.Rather than exposing the theory behind it,which could have been kind of abstractand probably a little bit boring,I thought it would be a great opportunityto do a little experiment.I would like you, the people here at TED,to tell your own story.
So I came with an interactive scenethat we are going to play together.I've asked Vicky —hello, Vicky —to control the main character for us.And your role — you, the audience —will be to make the choices.So Vicky and I don't knowwhat's going to happen,because it will all be basedon your decisions.
This scene comes from our next game,called "Detroit: Become Human,"and we are in the near future,where technology made possiblethe creation of androidsthat look exactly like human beings.We are in the shoesof this character called Connor,who is an android,and he can do very fancy thingswith coins, as you can see.He has this blue triangle on this chest,as all androids do,and now Vicky is in controlof this character.She can walk around, she can go anywhere,she can look around,she can interact with her environment,and now she can tell her own storiesby making choices.
So here we have our first choice.There is a fish on the ground.What should we do?Should we save it or should we leave it?Remember, we are under time pressure,so we'd better be fast.What should we do?
Audience: Save it!
David Cage: Save it? Save the fish?
(Video) (Fish plops)
DC: There we go.OK, we have an android who likes animals.OK, let's move on.Remember, we have a hostage situation.
(Video) Woman: Please, please,you've got to save my little girl!Wait — you're sending an android?
Officer: All right, ma'am, you need to go.
W: You can't do that!Why aren't you sending a real person?
DC: OK, she's not really happy.Her daughter's beentaken hostage by an android,and of course, she's in a state of shock.Now we can continueto explore this apartment.We see all the SWAT forces in place.But we need to findthis Captain Allen first.That's the first thing we need to do.So, again, we can go anywhere.Vicky's still in control of the character.Let's see — oh, I think thisis Captain Allen. He's on the phone.
(Video) Connor: Captain Allen,my name is Connor.I'm the android sent by CyberLife.
Captain Allen: Let's fireat everything that moves.It already shot down two of my men.We could easily get it,but they're on the edge of the balcony —it if falls,she falls.
DC: OK, now we need to decidewhat we want to ask the captain.What should be our choice?Deviant's name? Deviant'sbehavior? Emotional shock?
(Video) C: Has it experiencedan emotional shock recently?
Capt A: I haven't gota clue. Does it matter?
C: I need informationto determine the best approach.
DC: OK, a second choice.Maybe we can learn something.What should we choose?
Audience: Behavior.
DC: OK, deviant behavior, Vicky.
(Video) C: Do you know if it's beenbehaving strangely before this?
Capt A: Listen ... saving that kidis all that matters.
DC: OK, we are not going to learnanything from this guy.We need to do something.Let's try to go back in the lobby.Oh, wait — there's a room over thereon your right, Vicky, I think.Maybe there's something we can learn here.Oh, there's a tablet.Let's have a look.
(Video) Girl: This is Daniel,the coolest android in the world.Say "Hi," Daniel.
Daniel: Hello!
G: You're my bestie,we'll always be together!
DC: That was just one wayof playing the scenes,but there are manyother ways of playing it.Depending on the choices you make,we could have seen many different actions,many different consequences,many different outcomes.
So that gives you an idea of whatmy work is about as an interactive writer.Where a linear writer needsto deal with time and space,as an interactive writer,I need to deal with time,space and possibilities.I have to manage massive tree structures,where each branchis a new variation of the story.I need to think about allthe possibilities in a given sceneand try to imagineeverything that can happen.I need to deal with thousandsand thousands of variables,conditions and possibilities.As a consequence, where a film scriptis about 100 pages,an interactive script like thisis between four and five thousand pages.
So that gives you an ideaof what this work is about.But I think, in the end,the experience is very unique,because it is the resultof the collaborationbetween a writer creatingthis narrative landscapeand the player making his own decisions,telling his own storyand becoming the cowriterbut also the coactorand the codirector of the story.
Interactive storytelling is a revolutionin the way we tell stories.With the emergence of new platformslike interactive television,virtual reality and video games,it can become a new form of entertainmentand maybe even a new form of art.
I am convinced that in the coming years,we will see more and more movingand meaningful interactive experiences,created by a new generation of talents.This is a mediumwaiting for its Orson Wellesor its Stanley Kubrick,and I have no doubtthat they will soon emergeand be recognized as such.I believe that interactivestorytelling can bewhat cinema was in the 20th century:an art that deeply changes its time.
Thank you.

Some days, it feels likethe only thing we can agree onis that we can't agree on anything.Public discourse is broken.And we feel that everywhere —panelists on TVare screaming at each other,we go online to findcommunity and connection,and we end up leavingfeeling angry and alienated.In everyday life, probablybecause everyone else is yelling,we are so scared to get into an argumentthat we're willing not to engage at all.Contempt has replaced conversation.
My mission in life is to help usdisagree productively.To find ways to bring truth to light,to bring new ideas to life.I think — I hope —that there is a modelfor structured disagreementthat's kind of mutually respectfuland assumes a genuine desireto persuade and be persuaded.And to uncover it,let me take you back a little bit.
So, when I was 10 years old,I loved arguing.This, like, tantalizing possibilitythat you could convince someoneof your point of view,just with the power of your words.And perhaps unsurprisingly,my parents and teachersloved this somewhat less.
(Laughter)
And in much the same way as they decidedthat four-year-old Julia might benefitfrom gymnastics to burn off some energy,they decided that I might benefitfrom joining a debate team.That is, kind of, go somewhereto argue where they were not.
(Laughter)
For the uninitiated,the premises of formal debateare really straightforward:there's a big idea on the table —that we support civil disobedience,that we favor free trade —and one group of peoplewho speaks in favor of that idea,and one against.My first debatein the cavernous auditoriumof Canberra Girls Grammar Schoolwas kind of a bundleof all of the worst mistakesthat you see on cable news.It felt easier to me to attackthe person making the argumentrather than the substanceof the ideas themselves.When that same person challenged my ideas,it felt terrible, I felthumiliated and ashamed.And it felt to me likethe sophisticated response to thatwas to be as extreme as possible.And despite this very shaky entryinto the world of debate, I loved it.I saw the possibility, and over many yearsworked really hard at it,became really skilledat the technical craft of debate.I went on to win the World SchoolsDebating Championships three times.I know, you're just finding outthat this is a thing.
(Laughter)
But it wasn't untilI started coaching debaters,persuaders who are reallyat the top of their game,that I actually got it.The way that you reach peopleis by finding common ground.It's by separating ideas from identityand being genuinely open to persuasion.Debate is a way to organize conversationsabout how the world is, could, should be.Or to put it another way,I would love to offer youmy experience-backed,evidence-tested guideto talking to your cousin about politicsat your next family dinner;reorganizing the way in which your teamdebates new proposals;thinking about how we changeour public conversation.
And so, as an entry point into that:debate requires that we engagewith the conflicting idea,directly, respectfully, face to face.The foundation of debate is rebuttal.The idea that you make a claimand I provide a response,and you respond to my response.Without rebuttal, it's not debate,it's just pontificating.And I had originally imaginedthat the most successful debaters,really excellent persuaders,must be great at going to extremes.They must have some magical abilityto make the polarizing palatable.And it took me a reallylong time to figure outthat the opposite is actually true.People who disagree the most productivelystart by finding common ground,no matter how narrow it is.They identify the thingthat we can all agree onand go from there:the right to an education,equality between all people,the importance of safer communities.What they're doing is inviting usinto what psychologistscall shared reality.And shared realityis the antidote to alternative facts.
The conflict, of course, is still there.That's why it's a debate.Shared reality just gives usa platform to start to talk about it.But the trick of debateis that you end up doing it directly,face to face, across the table.And research backs upthat that really matters.Professor Juliana Schroederat UC Berkeley and her colleagueshave research that suggeststhat listening to someone's voiceas they make a controversial argumentis literally humanizing.It makes it easier to engagewith what that person has to say.
So, step away from the keyboards,start conversing.And if we are to expandthat notion a little bit,nothing is stopping us from pressing pauseon a parade of keynote speeches,the sequence of very politepanel discussions,and replacing some of thatwith a structured debate.All of our conferences could have,at their centerpiece,a debate over the biggest,most controversial ideas in the field.Each of our weekly team meetingscould devote 10 minutesto a debate about a proposal to changethe way in which that team works.And as innovative ideas go,this one is both easy and free.You could start tomorrow.
(Laughter)
And once we're inside this shared reality,debate also requiresthat we separate ideasfrom the identityof the person discussing them.So in formal debate, nothing is a topicunless it is controversial:that we should raisethe voting age, outlaw gambling.But the debaters don't choose their sides.So that's why it makes no senseto do what 10-year-old Julia did.Attacking the identity of the personmaking the argument is irrelevant,because they didn't choose it.Your only winning strategyis to engage with the best, clearest,least personal version of the idea.
And it might sound impossibleor naive to imaginethat you could ever take that notionoutside the high school auditorium.We spend so much time dismissing ideasas democrat or republican.Rejecting proposalsbecause they came from headquarters,or from a regionthat we think is not like ours.But it is possible.When I work with teams,trying to come up with the next big idea,or solve a really complex problem,I start by asking them, all of them,to submit ideas anonymously.
So by way of illustration, two years ago,I was working with multiplegovernment agenciesto generate new solutionsto reduce long-term unemployment.Which is one of those really wicked,sticky, well-studiedpublic policy problems.So exactly as I described,right at the beginning,potential solutions were capturedfrom everywhere.We aggregated them,each of them was producedon an identical template.At this point, they all look the same,they have no separate identity.And then, of course,they are discussed, picked over,refined, finalized.And at the end of that process,more than 20 of those new ideasare presented to the cabinet ministersresponsible for consideration.But more than half of those,the originator of those ideaswas someone who might have a hard timegetting the ear of a policy advisor.Or who, because of their identity,might not be takenentirely seriously if they did.Folks who answer the phones,assistants who manage calendars,representatives from agencieswho weren't always trusted.
Imagine if our news mediadid the same thing.You can kind of see it now —a weekly cable news segmentwith a big policy proposal on the tablethat doesn't call itliberal or conservative.Or a series of op-edsfor and against a big ideathat don't tell youwhere the writers worked.Our public conversations,even our private disagreements,can be transformed by debating ideas,rather than discussing identity.And then, the thing that debateallows us to do as human beingsis open ourselves,really open ourselves upto the possibility that we might be wrong.The humility of uncertainty.
One of the reasons it is so hardto disagree productivelyis because we becomeattached to our ideas.We start to believe that we own themand that by extension, they own us.But eventually, if you debate long enough,you will switch sides,you'll argue for and againstthe expansion of the welfare state.For and against compulsory voting.And that exerciseflips a kind of cognitive switch.The suspicions that you holdabout people who espouse beliefsthat you don't have, starts to evaporate.Because you can imagine yourselfstepping into those shoes.And as you're stepping into those,you're embracingthe humility of uncertainty.The possibility of being wrong.And it's that exact humilitythat makes us better decision-makers.
Neuroscientist and psychologist Mark Learyat Duke University and his colleagueshave found that peoplewho are able to practice —and it is a skill —what those researchers callintellectual humilityare more capable of evaluatinga broad range of evidence,are more objective when they do so,and become less defensivewhen confronted with conflicting evidence.All attributes that we want in our bosses,colleagues, discussion partners,decision-makers,all virtues that we would liketo claim for ourselves.And so, as we're embracingthat humility of uncertainty,we should be asking each other,all of us, a question.Our debate moderators, our news anchorsshould be asking itof our elective representativesand candidates for office, too."What is it that you have changedyour mind about and why?""What uncertainty are you humble about?"And this by the way, isn't some fantasyabout how public lifeand public conversations could work.It has precedent.
So, in 1969,beloved American children'stelevision presenter Mister Rogerssits impaneledbefore the United States congressionalsubcommittee on communications,chaired by the seemingly verycurmudgeonly John Pastore.And Mister Rogers is thereto make a kind of classic debate case,a really bold proposal:an increase in federal fundingfor public broadcasting.And at the outset,committee disciplinarianSenator Pastore is not having it.This is about to endreally poorly for Mister Rogers.But patiently, very reasonably,Mister Rogers makes the casewhy good quality children's broadcasting,the kinds of television programsthat talk about the drama that arisesin the most ordinary of families,matters to all of us.Even while it costs us.He invites us into a shared reality.
And on the other side of that table,Senator Pastore listens,engages and opens his mind.Out loud, in public, on the record.And Senator Pastoresays to Mister Rogers,"You know, I'm supposed to bea pretty tough guy,and this is the first timeI've had goosebumps in two days."And then, later, "It looks like youjust earned the 20 million dollars."We need many more Mister Rogers.People with the technical skillsof debate and persuasion.But on the other side of that table,we need many, many,many more Senator Pastores.And the magic of debateis that it lets you, it empowers youto be both Mister Rogersand Senator Pastore simultaneously.
When I work with those same teamsthat we talked about before,I ask them at the outset to pre-committo the possibility of being wrong.To explain to me and to each otherwhat it would take to change their minds.And that's all about the attitude,not the exercise.Once you start thinking aboutwhat it would take to change your mind,you start to wonder whyyou were quite so sure in the first place.There is so muchthat the practice of debatehas to offer usfor how to disagree productively.And we should bring it to our workplaces,our conferences,our city council meetings.And the principles of debate can transformthe way that we talk to one another,to empower us to stop talkingand to start listening.To stop dismissingand to start persuading.To stop shutting downand to start opening our minds.
Thank you so much.

Sea turtles are miraculous.First, they've been aroundsince the late Jurassic,roughly 150 million years ago.Cohorts of the dinosaurs,sea turtles have survivedthrough the challenges of eons,existing still today,where many othershave ended their evolutionary run.Second, throughout the centuriesand up till today,every living adult sea turtlehas overcome the odds,existing as a consequence of chance,skill, and capability.The gauntlet each sea turtle facesin the course of its lifetime goes thus:First, deposited as a clutch of leathery,ping-pong ball-sized eggsinto a nesting pit dug by its motherhigh on the beach,of the 50 to 200 eggs laid,roughly 20 percent will never hatch.Roughly a month and a halfafter having been laid,the surviving eggs hatch,and the young turtles, each small enoughto fit in the palm of your hand,squirm to the surface,emerging from the sand en masse,and making their desperatedash for the sea.Along the way, debris, pitfalls, crabs,gulls, raccoons, and other threatswill claim roughly 50 percent of thosewho rose from the sand.For those that actually reach the surf,they trade one set of threats for another,as they first facethe repelling force of the waves,and then find a whole newhost of predators awaiting them:Various fish, dolphins,sharks, and sea birds,as the young turtlescome to the surface for air.For their first few days of life,should they count themselvesamongst the living,the vulnerable turtlesswim frantically forward.Ultimately, they will oftenlook to settle in a patch of flotsam,preferably a patch of floating seaweed.Now for the next several months,they will seek to avoidthose that would eat them,find that which they might eat themselves,and not fall to the pressuresof challenging weatheror unfortunate currents.In this phase, roughly 50 percentof those who reach the surfwill perish.Ultimately, with the passage of years,the survivors will increase in size,from that of a dinner plate at year oneto that of a dinner table,in the case of one speciesat least, the leatherback,a decade or so later.With size comessome measure of protection.The only truly worrisome predatorsnow are some of the larger shark species—bulls, tigers, and whites —and the occasional killer whale.At approximately two decades of age,the survivors will be old enoughthemselves to breed,and continue the cyclewhich their very existence heralds.Of those that beganas eggs on a distant beach,now less than 10 percent remain,at least, those were the oddsprior to significant human interference.Over the past century, and in particularin the last several decades,human endeavors, from beach developmentto plastic refuse to poaching,long lines, nets,and even noxious chemicals, including oil,have upped the ante for sea turtles,causing their survival rate to dropto around one percent or less,from each nesting cycle.It is this added human pressurewhich has pushedeach of the eight sea turtle speciesinto either a threatenedor endangered state.For while they have evolvedto overcome a host of obstacles,the most recent has arisen so quicklyand at such scale that the speciesfind themselves overwhelmed.So let's quickly recap this cycle of odds.Using a hypothetical nesting season,for females may nestmultiple times in a single year,of 1,000 eggs, for sake of ease.1000 eggs laid.800 hatch.400 make it to the water.200 progress toward adulthood.20 survive to breeding age —that is, without human interference.Two survive to breeding agewith human interference.So a breeding adult sea turtleis the very embodiment of a long shot.It is the exception, not the rule.A jackpot.It is, in a very real sense,a miracle.
Take a momentand think about a virus.What comes to your mind?An illness?A fear?Probably something really unpleasant.And yet, viruses are not all the same.It's true, some of them causedevastating disease.But others can do the exact opposite —they can cure disease.These viruses are called "phages."
Now, the first time I heardabout phages was back in 2013.My father-in-law, who's a surgeon,was telling me about a womanhe was treating.The woman had a knee injury,required multiple surgeries,and over the course of these,developed a chronicbacterial infection in her leg.Unfortunately for her,the bacteria causing the infectionalso did not respondto any antibiotic that was available.So at this point, typically, the onlyoption left is to amputate the legto stop the infectionfrom spreading further.Now, my father-in-law was desperatefor a different kind of solution,and he applied for an experimental,last-resort treatment using phages.And guess what? It worked.Within three weeks of applying the phages,the chronic infection had healed up,where before, no antibiotic was working.I was fascinated by this weird conception:viruses curing an infection.To this day, I am fascinatedby the medical potential of phages.And I actually quit my job last yearto build a company in this space.
Now, what is a phage?The image that you see here was takenby an electron microscope.And that means what we see on the screenis in reality extremely tiny.The grainy thing in the middlewith the head, the long bodyand a number of feet —this is the image of a prototypical phage.It's kind of cute.
(Laughter)
Now, take a look at your hand.In our team, we've estimatedthat you have more than 10 billion phageson each of your hands.What are they doing there?
(Laughter)
Well, viruses are good at infecting cells.And phages are greatat infecting bacteria.And your hand, just likeso much of our body,is a hotbed of bacterial activity,making it an idealhunting ground for phages.Because after all, phages hunt bacteria.It's also important to know that phagesare extremely selective hunters.Typically, a phage will only infecta single bacterial species.So in this rendering here,the phage that you seehunts for a bacteriumcalled Staphylococcus aureus,which is known as MRSAin its drug-resistant form.It causes skin or wound infections.
The way the phage hunts is with its feet.The feet are actually extremelysensitive receptors,on the lookout for the right surfaceon a bacterial cell.Once it finds it,the phage will latch onto the bacterial cell walland then inject its DNA.DNA sits in the head of the phageand travels into the bacteriathrough the long body.At this point, the phagereprograms the bacteriainto producing lots of new phages.The bacteria, in effect,becomes a phage factory.Once around 50-100 phages have accumulatedwithin the bacteria cell,the phages are then ableto release a proteinthat disrupts the bacteria cell wall.As the bacteria bursts,the phages move outand go on the hunt againfor a new bacteria to infect.
Now, I'm sorry, this probablysounded like a scary virus again.But it's exactly this ability of phages —to multiply within the bacteriaand then kill them —that make them so interestingfrom a medical point of view.The other part that I findextremely interestingis the scale at which this is going on.Now, just five years ago,I really had no clue about phages.And yet, today I would tell youthey are part of a natural principle.Phages and bacteria go backto the earliest days of evolution.They have always existed in tandem,keeping each other in check.So this is really the story of yinand yang, of the hunter and the prey,at a microscopic level.Some scientists have even estimatedthat phages are the mostabundant organism on our planet.So even before we continuetalking about their medical potential,I think everybody should knowabout phages and their role on earth:they hunt, infect and kill bacteria.
Now, how come we have somethingthat works so well in nature,every day, everywhere around us,and yet, in most parts of the world,we do not have a single drug on the marketthat uses this principleto combat bacterial infections?The simple answer is: no onehas developed this kind of a drug yet,at least not one that conformsto the Western regulatory standardsthat set the normfor so much of the world.To understand why,we need to move back in time.
This is a picture of Félix d'Herelle.He is one of the two scientistscredited with discovering phages.Except, when he discovered themback in 1917, he had no cluewhat he had discovered.He was interested in a diseasecalled bacillary dysentery,which is a bacterial infectionthat causes severe diarrhea,and back then, was actuallykilling a lot of people,because after all, no cure for bacterialinfections had been invented.He was looking at samples from patientswho had survived this illness.And he found that somethingweird was going on.Something in the samplewas killing the bacteriathat were supposed to cause the disease.
To find out what was going on,he did an ingenious experiment.He took the sample, filtered ituntil he was sure that only somethingvery small could have remained,and then took a tiny drop and added itto freshly cultivated bacteria.And he observedthat within a number of hours,the bacteria had been killed.He then repeated this,again filtering, taking a tiny drop,adding it to the next batchof fresh bacteria.He did this in sequence 50 times,always observing the same effect.And at this point,he made two conclusions.First of all, the obvious one:yes, something was killing the bacteria,and it was in that liquid.The other one: it had to bebiologic in nature,because a tiny drop was sufficientto have a huge impact.He called the agent he had foundan "invisible microbe"and gave it the name "bacteriophage,"which, literally translated,means "bacteria eater."And by the way, this is oneof the most fundamental discoveriesof modern microbiology.So many modern techniques go backto our understanding of how phages work —in genomic editing,but also in other fields.And just today, the Nobel Prizein chemistry was announcedfor two scientists who work with phagesand develop drugs based on that.
Now, back in the 1920s and 1930s,people also immediately sawthe medical potential of phages.After all, albeit invisible,you had somethingthat reliably was killing bacteria.Companies that still exist today,such as Abbott, Squibb or Lilly,sold phage preparations.But the reality is, if you're startingwith an invisible microbe,it's very difficult to getto a reliable drug.Just imagine going to the FDA todayand telling them all aboutthat invisible virusyou want to give to patients.So when chemical antibioticsemerged in the 1940s,they completely changed the game.And this guy played a major role.
This is Alexander Fleming.He won the Nobel Prize in medicinefor his work contributingto the developmentof the first antibiotic, penicillin.And antibiotics really workvery differently than phages.For the most part, they inhibitthe growth of the bacteria,and they don't care so muchwhich kind of bacteria are present.The ones that we call broad-spectrumwill even work againsta whole bunch of bacteria out there.Compare that to phages,which work extremely narrowlyagainst one bacterial species,and you can see the obvious advantage.
Now, back then, this must have feltlike a dream come true.You had a patientwith a suspected bacterial infection,you gave him the antibiotic,and without really needing to knowanything else about the bacteriacausing the disease,many of the patients recovered.And so as we developedmore and more antibiotics,they, rightly so, became the first-linetherapy for bacterial infections.And by the way, they have contributedtremendously to our life expectancy.We are only able to docomplex medical interventionsand medical surgeries todaybecause we have antibiotics,and we don't risk the patientdying the very next dayfrom the bacterial infection that he mightcontract during the operation.
So we started to forget about phages,especially in Western medicine.And to a certain extent, even whenI was growing up, the notion was:we have solved bacterial infections;we have antibiotics.Of course, today,we know that this is wrong.Today, most of youwill have heard about superbugs.Those are bacteriathat have become resistantto many, if not all, of the antibioticsthat we have developedto treat this infection.
How did we get here?Well, we weren't as smartas we thought we were.As we started usingantibiotics everywhere —in hospitals, to treat and prevent;at home, for simple colds;on farms, to keep animals healthy —the bacteria evolved.In the onslaught of antibioticsthat were all around them,those bacteria survivedthat were best able to adapt.Today, we call these"multidrug-resistant bacteria."And let me put a scary number out there.In a recent study commissionedby the UK government,it was estimated that by 2050,ten million people could die every yearfrom multidrug-resistant infections.Compare that to eight million deathsfrom cancer per year today,and you can seethat this is a scary number.
But the good news is,phages have stuck around.And let me tell you, they are notimpressed by multidrug resistance.
(Laughter)
They are just as happily killingand hunting bacteria all around us.And they've also stayed selective,which today is really a good thing.Today, we are able to reliably identifya bacterial pathogenthat's causing an infectionin many settings.And their selectivity will help usavoid some of the side effectsthat are commonly associatedwith broad-spectrum antibiotics.But maybe the best news of all is:they are no longer an invisible microbe.We can look at them.And we did so together before.We can sequence their DNA.We understand how they replicate.And we understand the limitations.We are in a great placeto now develop strong and reliablephage-based pharmaceuticals.
And that's what's happeningaround the globe.More than 10 biotech companies,including our own company,are developing human-phage applicationsto treat bacterial infections.A number of clinical trialsare getting underway in Europe and the US.So I'm convincedthat we're standing on the vergeof a renaissance of phage therapy.And to me, the correct way to depictthe phage is something like this.
(Laughter)
To me, phages are the superheroesthat we have been waiting forin our fight againstmultidrug-resistant infections.
So the next time you think about a virus,keep this image in mind.After all, a phage mightone day save your life.
Thank you.

Hello, friends.I'm happy to see all of you here today.This is actually exactly what I sayto the people who visit usat the La Crosse Public Library.And I say it because I mean it.The children who comeinto our library are my friendsin that I care about their needsand their futures.I want them to be happy and successful.I hope that they'll find great booksor a movie that delights them.Or the solution to a tricky problem.
Libraries in generalhave this wonderful reputationof really caring about our communities.We put out mission statementsand statements of purposethat say that we connectour community to the broader world.We engage minds,we create lifelong learners.And these ideals are reallyimportant to us as libraries,because we know the power they haveto create a better world.A more connected world,a more engaged and empathetic world.Books have power, information has power.And for the powerless in our communities,being able to connect to thatis even more important.
In 1995, Betty Hart and Todd Risleypublished a study that foundthat working class familiesand those being served by welfareexperience what we now refer toas the "30 million word gap."Essentially, what they learnedis that children in these familiesare hearing so many fewer words each daythat by the time they are three years old,there's this enormous disparityin their learned language.And that gap in words follows themas they enter school,and it results in later reading,poorer reading skills,a lack of success overall.Children need to hear words every dayand they need to hearnot just our day-to-day conversation,they have to hear rare words:those outside the common lexiconwe share, of around 10,000.
I'm going to read you a short snippetfrom a children's bookby one of our favorite authorsin the children's room, Eric Carle.Some of you might know his work"The Very Hungry Caterpillar."But this is from "'Slowly, Slowly,Slowly,' said the Sloth."
"Finally, the sloth replied,'It is true that I am slow,quiet and boring.I am lackadaisical,I dawdle and I dillydally.I am also unflappable, languid, stoic,impassive, sluggish, lethargic,placid, calm, mellow,laid-back and, well, slothful!I am relaxed and tranquil,and I like to live in peace.But I am not lazy.'Then the sloth yawned and said,'That's just how I am.I like to do thingsslowly, slowly, slowly.'"So you can see from this very briefexample from one book in our libraryhow Eric Carle used 20 different wordsto get the same idea across to children.
Now we know that a lot of the familiesvisiting us at the library,a lot of our friends,are struggling financially.We know that some of themare living in poverty,and don't have enough to eator anywhere safe to live.We know that our friend James,who comes in after schooland is staying at a local shelter,isn't reading at grade leveland has probablynever read at grade level.We know we have that 30 million word gapand a corresponding achievement gapby the time kids enter the third grade,both of which directly correlateto income level.
So what's the responsibility of librariesin addressing these gaps?How can we help our friendsbe more successful, more educatedand some day, better global citizens?It starts with ensuringfree and equitable accessto everything libraries offer them.Books level the playing fieldby exposing children of everysocioeconomic background to words.At the library, we provide programsthat are based on the five tenantsof early literacy:playing, singing, talking,reading and writing.We offer programs for adultson computer classesand job-skills training.Business start-ups.We do all of this great workfor our community membersand at the same time, we counteract itby charging fines and fees of our patrons.
Today in La Crosse,10,000 of our users are unableto check out library materialsbecause of fines and fees.If we narrow in on our neighborhoodsexperiencing the most poverty,those where 82 percent of the student bodyis considered economically disadvantaged,the number rises to 23 percentof the neighborhood.And these are local numbers, it's true,but they hold true nationwide.In libraries across the countrythat charge fines,the poorest neighborhoods have the mostnumber of people blocked from use.In fact, the Colorado State Librarywas so worried about this,they published a white paperand they stated unequivocallythat it's the fear of finesthat keeps poor families out of libraries.
A colleague of mine took a ridein a Lyft in Atlanta last year,and he started chatting with his driverabout libraries, as we do.And she told him she grew upvisiting her local library, she loved it.But now that she's a parentwith three children of her own,there's no way she would allow themto get a library card,because of the strict deadlineslibraries impose.She said, "It would be likeanother credit card that I can't pay."
Meanwhile, when other librarieshave experimented with eliminating fines,like one in San Rafaelthat took away children's fines,they had a 126-percent increasein child card applicationswithin the first few months.When people aren't afraidof the fines they might accrue,they line up to accesswhat we have to offer.So what are we telling people, then?We have these two disparate ideas.
On the one hand,we're champions of democracyand we claim that we're there so thatevery citizen can educate themselves.We're advocates for the powerearly literacy hasto reduce that achievement gapand eliminate the word gap.We tell people, "We're here to help you."On the other hand,if you're struggling financially,and you make a mistake,the kind of mistakethat anyone in this room could make —your tote bag that belongs to the librarysits by your back doorfor a couple of weekslonger than it should,you lose a CD,you spill your coffee on a book,suddenly, we're not here for youso much anymore,because if that happens,we're going to make you pay for it.And if you can't pay for it,you're out of luck.
I have been a librarianfor a lot of years.And in the past few years,I myself have paidover 500 dollars in late fines.Now, you might wonder why,I mean, I'm there every day,and I certainly know how the system works.But like all of our friendsat the library,I am busy, I lose track of things,my house is sometimes messy,and I have lost a DVD or twounder the sofa.And I have been fortunate enoughto be able to paythat 500 dollarsover the last several years.If not happily, I at leasthad the means to do it.So is that fair and equitable serviceif some of us can pay our finesand continue to operate as we always have,and others of us make one mistakeand no longer are welcome back?It's simply not.
Now, why would we continueto operate under a model that hurtsour most vulnerable patrons the most?There are reasons.There are reasons like responsibility.There are some libraries that really feelthat it's our jobto teach people responsibility.And they haven't figured outthat there might be ways to do thatthat don't equate to dollars.There's also this idea that we sharethe resources collectively in a community,and so we have to take turns.If I keep my "My Little Pony"movie for too long,and somebody elsewants to watch it, it's not fair.And then, there's the money.Community membersoften love their libraries,and they don't want us to not be ableto sustain the services we offer.
Luckily, we can addressall of these things in a variety of wayswithout scaring awayour most vulnerable populations.Some libraries have goneto a Netflix model.You might be familiar with this:you check things out,when you're done with them,you return them.If you don't return them,you can't check more things out,but once you do,it's all forgiven, it's fine.You can check out again.Others continue to charge fines,but they want to offer alternativesto their library patrons,and so they do things like food for fines,where you bring in canned goods,or read away your fines,where you can read off your fines.There's even another library in Wisconsinthat offers scratch-off ticketsat their counter,so you can scratch off and get10 or 20 percent off your fines that day.And there are amnesty days.One day a year, you bring backyour late materialsand all is forgiven.There was a library in San Franciscothat did an amnesty day last year,and they welcomed back5,000 users who had been blocked.That same day, they receivedmore than 700,000 items that were overdue.Among them was one bookthat was 100 years overdue.
So I know that sounds ridiculous,but I know from experiencethat people will stay awayfrom the libraryrather than facethe authority of the librarianwhen they have late items.As Michael might have mentioned,I've been a librarian for 15 yearsand my mom hasn't beenin a library in decades,because when she was young,she lost a book.
So, these are great baby steps.But they don't go far enough,because they make peoplejump through hoops.They have to come on the right days,at the right times.They might have to haveextra food to share.They want to read away their fines,they need to be literate.If we want peopleto use the library again,we should just get ridof fines altogether.
Now, you might thinkI've forgotten a money piece,where we need to finance libraries, right?But there's a couple of things to considerwhen we think about how fines functionin library budgets.The first is that fines have never beena stable source of revenue.They've always fluctuated,and in fact, they've continued to go downover the last few decades.When the recession hit, especially,people's ability to pay was hit, as well.So for a lot of those 10,000 friendsthat we've got at the librarythat aren't able to use it,they might never be able to pay us.When we talk abouteliminating their fines,we're not losing moneyso much as the idea of money.And thirdly, you might besurprised to knowfines on average, nationally,are about one and a half percentof a library's operating budget.Now that can still be a lot of money.If you're looking at a large libraryor a large library system,the dollar amount can be high.But it's an achievable cutfor most libraries to absorb.
And finally, and maybe most importantly,fines cost us money to collect.When you start to factor inall of the ways that we collect fines,supplies like mailers that we send outto remind people of their fines,services, like collectionsmanagement services,even telephone and email notificationscan cost libraries money.And staff time is a hugecost for libraries.So that our frontline staffis standing there,talking to people about their fines,sometimes arguing with people about fines.When we eliminate all of those pieces,if we got rid of fines, we might actuallysave money in our libraries.Or at the very least,we would be ableto reallocate our staff timeto pursuits that better fitthose missions we talked about.
The other thing I want everybodyto come away understandingis that fines don't actually workto do what we think they do.The debate about fines —whether we should fine,how much we should fine, it isn't new.We've been talking about itfor almost 100 years.As long as that book was overdue.Study after study has shownthat the reason libraries fineis because of strongly held beliefsabout the effectivenessof getting materials back on timebacked by no evidence.Basically, we finebecause we've always fined.So, the best option for your librariesis to put their mission first.And they will do thatif their community members ask it of them.
When you leave here,I hope you'll visit your public libraryand talk to your librarians,talk to your neighborsand community memberswho serve on library boards.Tell them that you knowhow important literacy isto everyone in your community.That if our librariesare truly for everyone,that they have to get rid of finesand embrace their entire community.
Thank you.

How many times can youfold a piece of paper?Assume that one had a pieceof paper that was very fine,like the kind they typicallyuse to print the Bible.In reality, it seems like a piece of silk.To qualify these ideas,let's say you have a paperthat's one-thousandthof a centimeter in thickness.That is 10 to the powerof minus three centimeters,which equals .001 centimeters.Let's also assume that you havea big piece of paper,like a page out of the newspaper.Now we begin to fold it in half.How many times do you thinkit could be folded like that?And another question:If you could fold the paper over and over,as many times as you wish,say 30 times,what would you imaginethe thickness of the paper would be then?Before you move on,I encourage you to actually thinkabout a possible answer to this question.OK.After we have folded the paper once,it is now two thousandthsof a centimeter in thickness.If we fold it in half once again,the paper will becomefour thousandths of a centimeter.With every fold we make,the paper doubles in thickness.And if we continue to foldit again and again,always in half, we would confrontthe following situationafter 10 folds.Two to the power of 10,meaning that you multiplytwo by itself 10 times,is one thousand and24 thousandths of a centimeter,which is a little bit over one centimeter.Assume we continue foldingthe paper in half.What will happen then?If we fold it 17 times,we'll get a thicknessof two to the power of 17,which is 131 centimeters,and that equals just over four feet.If we were able to fold it 25 times,then we would get two to the power of 25,which is 33,554 centimeters,just over 1,100 feet.That would make it almostas tall as the Empire State Building.It's worthwhile to stop hereand reflect for a moment.Folding a paper in half, even a paperas fine as that of the Bible,25 times would give us a paperalmost a quarter of a mile.What do we learn?This type of growthis called exponential growth,and as you see, just by folding a paperwe can go very far, but very fast too.Summarizing, if we fold a paper 25 times,the thickness is almosta quarter of a mile.30 times, the thickness reaches 6.5 miles,which is about the averageheight that planes fly.40 times, the thicknessis nearly 7,000 miles,or the average GPS satellite's orbit.48 times, the thicknessis way over one million miles.Now, if you think that the distancebetween the Earth and the Moonis less than 250,000 miles,then starting with a piece of Bible paperand folding it 45 times,we get to the Moon.And if we double it one more time,we get back to Earth.
In 2015, the leaders of the worldmade a big promise.A promise that over the next 15 years,the lives of billions of peopleare going to get betterwith no one left behind.That promise is the SustainableDevelopment Goals —the SDGs.We're now three years in;a fifth of the way into the journey.The clock is ticking.If we offtrack now,it's going to get harder and harderto hit those goals.So what I want to do for you todayis give you a snapshoton where we are today,some projections on where we're headingand some ideas on thingswe might need to do differently.
Now, the SDGs are of coursespectacularly complicated.I would expect nothing lessfrom the United Nations.
(Laughter)
How many goals?Maybe something tried and tested,like three, seven or 10.No, let's pick a prime numberhigher than 10.Seventeen goals.I congratulate those of youwho've memorized them already.For the rest of us, here they are.
Seventeen goals rangingfrom ending povertyto inclusive citiesto sustainable fisheries;all a comprehensive planfor the future of our world.But sadly, a planwithout the data to measure it.So how are we going to track progress?Well, I'm going to use todaythe Social Progress Index.It's a measure ofthe quality of life of countries,ranging from the basicneeds of survival —food, water, shelter, safety —through to the foundationsof well-being —education, information,health and the environment —and opportunity —rights, freedom of choice, inclusivenessand access to higher education.
Now, the Social Progress Indexdoesn't look like the SDGs,but fundamentally,it's measuring the same concepts,and the Social Progress Indexhas the advantage that we have the data.We have 51 indicatorsdrawn from trusted sourcesto measure these concepts.And also, what we can dobecause it's an index,is add together all those indicatorsto give us an aggregate scoreabout how we're performingagainst the total package of the SDGs.Now, one caveat.The Social Progress Indexis a measure of quality of life.We're not looking at whetherthis can be achievedwithin the planet's environmental limits.You will need other tools to do that.
So how are we doing on the SDGs?Well, I'm going to put the SDGson a scale of zero to 100.And zero is the absolute worst scoreon each of those 51 indicators:absolute social progress, zero.And then 100 is the minimum standardrequired to achieve those SDGs.A hundred is wherewe want to get to by 2030.So, where did we start on this journey?Fortunately, not at zero.In 2015, the world scoreagainst the SDGs was 69.1.Some way on the way therebut quite a long way to go.
Now let me also emphasizethat this world forecast,which is based on data from 180 countries,is population weighted.So China has more weight in than Comoros;India has more weight in than Iceland.But we could unpack thisand see how the countries are doing.And the country today that is closestto achieving the SDGs is Denmark.And the country with the furthest to gois Central African Republic.And everyone else is somewhere in between.So the challenge for the SDGsis to try and sweep all these dotsacross to the right, to 100 by 2030.Can we get there?Well, with the Social Progress Index,we've got some time series data.So we have some idea of the trendthat the countries are on,on which we can build some projections.
So let's have a look.Let's start with ourtop-performing country, Denmark.And yes, I'm pleased to say that Denmarkis forecast to achieve the SDGs by 2030.Maybe not surprising, but I'll take a win.Let's look at some of the otherricher countries of the world —the G7.And we find that Germany and Japanwill get there or thereabouts.But Canada, France, the UK and Italyare all going to fall short.And the United States?Quite some way back.Now, this is sort of worrying news.But these are the richestcountries in the world,not the most populous.So let's take a look nowat the biggest countries in the world,the ones that will most affectwhether or not we achieve the SDGs.
And here they are —countries in the world with a populationof higher than 100 million,ranging from China to Ethiopia.Obviously, the US and Japanwould be in that list,but we've looked at them already.So here we are.The biggest countries in the world;the dealbreakers for the SDGs.And the country that's going to makemost progress towards the SDGsis Mexico.Mexico is going to get to about 87,so just shy of wherethe US is going to getbut quite some way off our SDG target.Russia comes next.Then China and Indonesia.Then Brazil — might've expectedBrazil to do a bit better.Philippines,and then a step down to India,Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria,and then Ethiopia.So none of these countriesare going to hit the SDGs.And we can then take these numbersin all the countries of the worldto give ourselves a world forecaston achieving that totalpackage of the SDGs.So remember, in 2015 we started at 69.1.I'm pleased to saythat over the last three years,we have made some progress.In 2018, we've hit 70.5,and if we project that rateof progress forward to 2030,that's going to get us to 75.2,which is obviouslya long way short of our target.Indeed, on current trends,we won't hit the 2030 targets until 2094.Now, I don't know about you,but I certainly don'twant to wait that long.
So what can we do about this?Well, the first thing to do iswe've got to call out the rich countries.Here are the countriesclosest to the SDGs,with the greatest resources,and they're falling short.Maybe they thinkthat this is like the Old Worldwhere goals for the UN are justfor poor countries and not for them.Well, you're wrong.The SDGs are for every country,and it's shameful that these wealthycountries are falling short.Every country needs a planto implement the SDGsand deliver them for their citizens.G7, other rich countries —get your act together.
The second thing we can dois look a bit further into the dataand see where there are opportunitiesto accelerate progressor there are negative trendsthat we can reverse.So I'm going to take you into three areas.One where we're doing quite well,one where we really should be doing betterand another where we've gotsome real problems.
Let's start with the good news,and I want to talk about what we callnutrition and basic medical care.This covers SDG 2 on no hungerand the basic elements of SDG 3 on health,so maternal and child mortality,infectious diseases, etc ...This is an area where mostof the rich world has hit the SDGs.And we also find,looking at our big countries,that the most advancedhave got pretty close.Here are our 11 big countries,and if you look at the top,Brazil and Russiaare pretty close to the SDG target.But at the bottom —Ethiopia, Pakistan — a long way to go.That's where we are in 2018.What's our trajectory?On the current trajectory,how far are we going to get by 2030?Well, let's have a look.Well, what we see is a lot of progress.See Bangladesh in the middle.If Bangladesh maintainsits current rate of progress,it could get very closeto that SDG target.And Ethiopia at the bottomis making a huge amount of progressat the moment.If that can be maintained,Ethiopia could get a long way.We add this all upfor all the countries of the worldand our projectionis a score of 94.5 by 2030.And if countries like the Philippines,which have grown more slowly,could accelerate progress,then we could get a lot closer.
So there are reasons to be optimisticabout SDGs 2 and 3.But there's another very basic areaof the SDGs where we're doing less well,which is SDG 6, on water and sanitation.Again, it's an SDGwhere most of the rich countrieshave already achieved the targets.And again, for our big countries —our big 11 emerging countries,we see that some of the countries,like Russia and Mexico,are very close to the target,but Nigeria and other countriesare a very long way back.So how are we doing on this target?What progress are we going to makeover the next 12 yearsbased on the current direction of travel?Well, here we go ...and yes, there is some progress.Our top four countriesare all hitting the SDG targets —some are moving forward quite quickly.But it's not enoughto really move us forward significantly.What we see is thatfor the world as a whole,we're forecasting a scoreof around 85, 86 by 2030 —not fast enough.
Now, obviously this is not good news,but I think what this data also showsis that we could be doing a lot better.Water and sanitation is a solved problem.It's about scalingthat solution everywhere.So if we could accelerate progressin some of those countrieswho are improving more slowly —Nigeria, the Philippines, etc. —then we could geta lot closer to the goal.Indeed, I think SDG 6is probably the biggest opportunityof all the SDGs for a step change.
So that's an area we could do better.Let's look finally at an areawhere we are struggling,which is what we callpersonal rights and inclusiveness.This is covering conceptsacross a range of SDGs.SDG 1 on poverty,SDG 5 on gender equality,SDG 10 on inequality,SDG 11 on inclusive citiesand SDG 16 on peace and justice.So across those SDGs there are themesaround rights and inclusiveness,and those may seemless immediate or pressingthan things like hunger and disease,but rights and inclusion are criticalto an agenda of no one left behind.So how are we doing on those issues?Let's start off with personal rights.What I'm going to do firstis show you our big countries in 2015.So here they are,and I've put the USA and Japan back in,so it's our 13 biggestcountries in the world.And we see a wide range of scores.The United States at the topwith Japan hitting the goals;China a long way behind.So what's been our direction of travelon the rights agendaover the last three years?Let's have a look.Well, what we see is actually pretty ugly.The majority of the countriesare standing still or moving backwards,and big countries like Brazil,India, China, Bangladeshhave all seen significant declines.This is worrying.
Let's have a look now at inclusiveness.And inclusiveness is looking at thingslike violence and discriminationagainst minorities,gender equity, LGBT inclusion, etc...And as a result, we see that the scoresfor our big countries are generally lower.Every country, rich and pooralike, is strugglingwith building an inclusive society.But what's our direction of travel?Are we building more inclusive countries?Let's have a look — progress to 2018.And again we seethe world moving backwards:most countries static,a lot of countries going backwards —Bangladesh moving backwards —but also, two of the countriesthat were leading —Brazil and the United States —have gone backwards significantlyover the last three years.
Let's sum this up nowfor the world as a whole.And what we see on personal rightsfor the whole worldis we're forecasting actuallya decline in the score on personal rightsto about 60,and then this decline in the scoreof inclusiveness to about 42.Now, obviously these thingscan change quite quicklywith rights and with changes in law,changes in attitudes,but we have to acceptthat on current trends,this is probably the mostworrying aspect of the SDGs.How I've depressed you ...
(Laughter)
I hope not because I think what we do seeis that progress is happeningin a lot of placesand there are opportunitiesfor accelerating progress.We are living in a worldthat is tantalizingly closeto ensuring that no one need dieof hunger or malaria or diarrhea.If we can focus our efforts,mobilize resources,galvanize the political will,that step change is possible.
But in focusing on thosereally basic, solvable SDGs,we mustn't forget the whole package.The goals are an unwieldyset of indicators, goals and targets,but they also includethe challenges our world faces.The fact that the SDGsare focusing attentionon the fact that we face a crisisin personal rights and inclusivenessis a positive.If we forget that,if we choose to double downon the SDGs that we can solve,if we go for SDG à la carteand pick the most easy SDGs,then we will have missedthe point of the SDGs,we will miss the goalsand we will have failedon the promise of the SDGs.
Thank you.

When I was in fourth grade,my teacher said to us one day:"There are as many even numbersas there are numbers.""Really?", I thought.Well, yeah, there areinfinitely many of both,so I suppose there arethe same number of them.But even numbers are only partof the whole numbers,all the odd numbers are left over,so there's got to be more whole numbersthan even numbers, right?To see what my teacher was getting at,let's first think about what it meansfor two sets to be the same size.What do I mean when I sayI have the same number of fingerson my right hand as I do on left hand?Of course, I have five fingers on each,but it's actually simpler than that.I don't have to count, I only need to seethat I can match them up, one to one.In fact, we think that some ancient peoplewho spoke languages that didn't have wordsfor numbers greater than threeused this sort of magic.For instance, if you letyour sheep out of a pen to graze,you can keep track of how many went outby setting aside a stone for each one,and putting those stones backone by one when the sheep return,so you know if any are missingwithout really counting.As another example of matching beingmore fundamental than counting,if I'm speaking to a packed auditorium,where every seat is takenand no one is standing,I know that there are the same numberof chairs as people in the audience,even though I don't knowhow many there are of either.So, what we really mean when we saythat two sets are the same sizeis that the elements in those setscan be matched up one by one in some way.My fourth grade teacher showed usthe whole numbers laid out in a row,and below each we have its double.As you can see, the bottom rowcontains all the even numbers,and we have a one-to-one match.That is, there are as manyeven numbers as there are numbers.But what still bothers us is our distressover the fact that even numbersseem to be only part of the whole numbers.But does this convince youthat I don't havethe same number of fingerson my right hand as I do on my left?Of course not.It doesn't matter if you try to matchthe elements in some wayand it doesn't work,that doesn't convince us of anything.If you can find one wayin which the elementsof two sets do match up,then we say those two sets havethe same number of elements.Can you make a list of all the fractions?This might be hard,there are a lot of fractions!And it's not obvious what to put first,or how to be sureall of them are on the list.Nevertheless, there is a very clever waythat we can make a listof all the fractions.This was first done by Georg Cantor,in the late eighteen hundreds.First, we put allthe fractions into a grid.They're all there.For instance, you can find, say, 117/243,in the 117th row and 243rd column.Now we make a list out of thisby starting at the upper leftand sweeping back and forth diagonally,skipping over any fraction, like 2/2,that represents the same numberas one the we've already picked.We get a list of all the fractions,which means we've createda one-to-one matchbetween the whole numbersand the fractions,despite the fact that we thoughtmaybe there ought to be more fractions.OK, here's where it getsreally interesting.You may know that not all real numbers— that is, not all the numberson a number line — are fractions.The square rootof two and pi, for instance.Any number like this is called irrational.Not because it's crazy, or anything,but because the fractions areratios of whole numbers,and so are called rationals;meaning the rest arenon-rational, that is, irrational.Irrationals are representedby infinite, non-repeating decimals.So, can we make a one-to-one matchbetween the whole numbersand the set of all the decimals,both the rationals and the irrationals?That is, can we makea list of all the decimal numbers?Cantor showed that you can't.Not merely that we don't know how,but that it can't be done.Look, suppose you claim you have madea list of all the decimals.I'm going to show youthat you didn't succeed,by producing a decimalthat is not on your list.I'll construct my decimalone place at a time.For the first decimal place of my number,I'll look at the first decimal placeof your first number.If it's a one, I'll make mine a two;otherwise I'll make mine a one.For the second place of my number,I'll look at the second placeof your second number.Again, if yours is a one,I'll make mine a two,and otherwise I'll make mine a one.See how this is going?The decimal I've producedcan't be on your list.Why? Could it be, say, your 143rd number?No, because the 143rd place of my decimalis different from the 143rd placeof your 143rd number.I made it that way.Your list is incomplete.It doesn't contain my decimal number.And, no matter what list you give me,I can do the same thing,and produce a decimalthat's not on that list.So we're faced with thisastounding conclusion:The decimal numberscannot be put on a list.They represent a bigger infinitythat the infinity of whole numbers.So, even though we're familiarwith only a few irrationals,like square root of two and pi,the infinity of irrationalsis actually greaterthan the infinity of fractions.Someone once said that the rationals— the fractions — arelike the stars in the night sky.The irrationals are like the blackness.Cantor also showed that,for any infinite set,forming a new set made ofall the subsets of the original setrepresents a bigger infinitythan that original set.This means that,once you have one infinity,you can always make a bigger oneby making the set of all subsetsof that first set.And then an even bigger oneby making the setof all the subsets of that one.And so on.And so, there are an infinite numberof infinities of different sizes.If these ideas make youuncomfortable, you are not alone.Some of the greatestmathematicians of Cantor's daywere very upset with this stuff.They tried to make these differentinfinities irrelevant,to make mathematics workwithout them somehow.Cantor was even vilified personally,and it got so bad for himthat he suffered severe depression,and spent the last half of his lifein and out of mental institutions.But eventually, his ideas won out.Today, they're consideredfundamental and magnificent.All research mathematiciansaccept these ideas,every college math major learns them,and I've explained themto you in a few minutes.Some day, perhaps,they'll be common knowledge.There's more.We just pointed outthat the set of decimal numbers— that is, the real numbers —is a bigger infinitythan the set of whole numbers.Cantor wonderedwhether there are infinitiesof different sizesbetween these two infinities.He didn't believe there were,but couldn't prove it.Cantor's conjecture became knownas the continuum hypothesis.In 1900, the greatmathematician David Hilbertlisted the continuum hypothesisas the most importantunsolved problem in mathematics.The 20th century sawa resolution of this problem,but in a completely unexpected,paradigm-shattering way.In the 1920s, Kurt Gödel showedthat you can never provethat the continuum hypothesis is false.Then, in the 1960s, Paul J. Cohen showedthat you can never provethat the continuum hypothesis is true.Taken together, these results meanthat there are unanswerablequestions in mathematics.A very stunning conclusion.Mathematics is rightly consideredthe pinnacle of human reasoning,but we now know that even mathematicshas its limitations.Still, mathematics has some trulyamazing things for us to think about.
In the late 19th century,scientists were trying to solve a mystery.They found that if they hada vacuum tube like this oneand applied a high voltage across it,something strange happened.They called them cathode rays.But the question was:What were they made of?
In England, the 19th centuryphysicist, J.J. Thompson,conducted experiments usingmagnets and electricity, like this.And he came to an incredible revelation.These rays were madeof negatively charged particlesaround 2,000 times lighterthan the hydrogen atom,the smallest thing they knew.So Thompson had discoveredthe first subatomic particle,which we now call electrons.
Now, at the time, this seemed to bea completely impractical discovery.I mean, Thompson didn't thinkthere were any applications of electrons.Around his lab in Cambridge,he used to like to propose a toast:"To the electron.May it never be of use to anybody."
(Laughter)
He was strongly in favor of doing researchout of sheer curiosity,to arrive at a deeperunderstanding of the world.And what he founddid cause a revolution in science.But it also caused a second,unexpected revolution in technology.Today, I'd like to make a casefor curiosity-driven research,because without it,none of the technologiesI'll talk about todaywould have been possible.
Now, what Thompson found herehas actually changed our view of reality.I mean, I think I'm standing on a stage,and you think you're sitting in a seat.But that's just the electrons in your bodypushing back againstthe electrons in the seat,opposing the force of gravity.You're not even really touching the seat.You're hovering ever so slightly above it.But in many ways, our modern societywas actually built on this discovery.I mean, these tubeswere the start of electronics.And then for many years,most of us actually had one of these,if you remember, in your living room,in cathode ray tube televisions.But — I mean, how impoverishedwould our lives beif the only invention that had comefrom here was the television?
(Laughter)
Thankfully, this tube was just a start,because something else happenswhen the electrons herehit the piece of metal inside the tube.Let me show you.Pop this one back on.So as the electronsscreech to a halt inside the metal,their energy gets thrown out againin a form of high-energy light,which we call X-rays.
(Buzzing)
(Buzzing)
And within 15 yearsof discovering the electron,these X-rays were being usedto make images inside the human body,helping soldiers' livesbeing saved by surgeons,who could then find pieces of bulletsand shrapnel inside their bodies.But there's no way we could havecome up with that technologyby asking scientists to buildbetter surgical probes.Only research done out of sheer curiosity,with no application in mind,could have given us the discoveryof the electron and X-rays.
Now, this tube also threw open the gatesfor our understanding of the universeand the field of particle physics,because it's also the first,very simple particle accelerator.Now, I'm an accelerator physicist,so I design particle accelerators,and I try and understand how beams behave.And my field's a bit unusual,because it crosses betweencuriosity-driven researchand technology withreal-world applications.But it's the combinationof those two thingsthat gets me really excitedabout what I do.Now, over the last 100 years,there have been far too many examplesfor me to list them all.But I want to share with you just a few.
In 1928, a physicist named Paul Diracfound something strange in his equations.And he predicted, based purelyon mathematical insight,that there ought to bea second kind of matter,the opposite to normal matter,that literally annihilateswhen it comes in contact:antimatter.I mean, the idea sounded ridiculous.But within four years, they'd found it.And nowadays, we use itevery day in hospitals,in positron emission tomography,or PET scans, used for detecting disease.
Or, take these X-rays.If you can get these electronsup to a higher energy,so about 1,000 times higherthat this tube,the X-rays that those producecan actually deliver enoughionizing radiation to kill human cells.And if you can shape and directthose X-rays where you want them to go,that allows us to do an incredible thing:to treat cancer without drugs or surgery,which we call radiotherapy.In countries like Australia and the UK,around half of all cancer patientsare treated using radiotherapy.And so, electron acceleratorsare actually standard equipmentin most hospitals.
Or, a little closer to home:if you have a smartphone or a computer —and this is TEDx, so you've gotboth with you right now, right?Well, inside those devicesare chips that are madeby implanting single ions into silicon,in a process called ion implantation.And that uses a particle accelerator.
Without curiosity-driven research, though,none of these things would exist at all.So, over the years, we really learnedto explore inside the atom.And to do that, we had to learnto develop particle accelerators.The first ones we developedlet us split the atom.And then we got to higherand higher energies;we created circular acceleratorsthat let us delve into the nucleusand then create new elements, even.And at that point, we were no longerjust exploring inside the atom.We'd actually learnedhow to control these particles.We'd learned how to interactwith our worldon a scale that's too smallfor humans to see or touchor even sense that it's there.
And then we built largerand larger accelerators,because we were curiousabout the nature of the universe.As we went deeper and deeper,new particles started popping up.Eventually, we got to hugering-like machinesthat take two beams of particlesin opposite directions,squeeze them downto less than the width of a hairand smash them together.And then, using Einstein's E=mc2,you can take all of that energyand convert it into new matter,new particles which we ripfrom the very fabric of the universe.
Nowadays, there areabout 35,000 accelerators in the world,not including televisions.And inside each one of theseincredible machines,there are hundreds and billionsof tiny particles,dancing and swirling in systemsthat are more complexthan the formation of galaxies.You guys, I can't even begin to explainhow incredible it isthat we can do this.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So I want to encourage youto invest your time and energyin people that docuriosity-driven research.It was Jonathan Swift who once said,"Vision is the artof seeing the invisible."And over a century ago,J.J. Thompson did just that,when he pulled back the veilon the subatomic world.
And now we need to investin curiosity-driven research,because we have so manychallenges that we face.And we need patience;we need to give scientists the time,the space and the meansto continue their quest,because history tells usthat if we can remaincurious and open-mindedabout the outcomes of research,the more world-changingour discoveries will be.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So a friend of mine was ridingin a taxi to the airport the other day,and on the way, she was chattingwith the taxi driver,and he said to her, with total sincerity,"I can tell you are a really good person."And when she told me this story later,she said she couldn't believehow good it made her feel,that it meant a lot to her.Now that may seemlike a strong reaction from my friendto the words of a total stranger,but she's not alone.
I'm a social scientist.I study the psychology of good people,and research in my field saysmany of us care deeplyabout feeling like a good personand being seen as a good person.Now, your definition of "good person"and your definition of "good person"and maybe the taxi driver'sdefinition of "good person" —we may not all have the same definition,but within whatever our definition is,that moral identityis important to many of us.
Now, if somebody challenges it,like they question us for a joke we tell,or maybe we sayour workforce is homogenous,or a slippery business expense,we go into red-zone defensivenessa lot of the time.I mean, sometimes we call outall the ways in which we helppeople from marginalized groups,or we donate to charity,or the hours we volunteer to nonprofits.We work to protectthat good person identity.It's important to many of us.
But what if I told you this?What if I told you that our attachmentto being good peopleis getting in the wayof us being better people?What if I told you that our definitionof "good person" is so narrow,it's scientifically impossible to meet?And what if I told youthe path to being better peoplejust begins with letting goof being a good person?
Now, let me tell you a little bitabout the researchabout how the human mind worksto explain.The brain relies on shortcutsto do a lot of its work.That means a lot of the time,your mental processes are taking placeoutside of your awareness,like in low-battery, low-power modein the back of your mind.That's, in fact, the premiseof bounded rationality.Bounded rationality isthe Nobel Prize-winning ideathat the human mindhas limited storage resources,limited processing power,and as a result, it relies on shortcutsto do a lot of its work.So for example,some scientists estimatethat in any given moment ...Better, better click, right? There we go.
(Laughter)
At any given moment,11 million pieces of informationare coming into your mind.Eleven million.And only 40 of themare being processed consciously.So 11 million, 40.
I mean, has this ever happened to you?Have you ever hada really busy day at work,and you drive home,and when you get in the door,you realize you don'teven remember the drive home,like whether you hadgreen lights or red lights.You don't even remember.You were on autopilot.Or have you ever opened the fridge,looked for the butter,swore there is no butter,and then realized the butterwas right in front of you the whole time?These are the kinds of "whoops" momentsthat make us giggle,and this is what happens in a brainthat can handle 11 millionpieces of information coming inwith only 40 being processed consciously.That's the bounded partof bounded rationality.
This work on bounded rationalityis what's inspired work I've donewith my collaboratorsMax Bazerman and Mahzarin Banaji,on what we call bounded ethicality.So it's the same premiseas bounded rationality,that we have a human mindthat is bounded in some sort of wayand relying on shortcuts,and that those shortcutscan sometimes lead us astray.With bounded rationality,perhaps it affects the cerealwe buy in the grocery store,or the product we launch in the boardroom.With bounded ethicality, the human mind,the same human mind,is making decisions,and here, it's about who to hire next,or what joke to tellor that slippery business decision.
So let me give you an exampleof bounded ethicality at work.Unconscious bias is one placewhere we see the effectsof bounded ethicality.So unconscious bias refersto associations we have in our mind,the shortcuts your brain is usingto organize information,very likely outside of your awareness,not necessarily lining upwith your conscious beliefs.Researchers Nosek, Banaji and Greenwaldhave looked at datafrom millions of people,and what they've found is, for example,most white Americanscan more quickly and easilyassociate white people and good thingsthan black people and good things,and most men and womencan more quickly and easily associatemen and science than women and science.And these associationsdon't necessarily line upwith what people consciously think.They may havevery egalitarian views, in fact.So sometimes, that 11 millionand that 40 just don't line up.
And here's another example:conflicts of interest.So we tend to underestimatehow much a small gift —imagine a ballpoint pen or dinner —how much that small giftcan affect our decision making.We don't realize that our mindis unconsciously lining up evidenceto support the point of viewof the gift-giver,no matter how hard we're consciouslytrying to be objective and professional.We also see bounded ethicality —despite our attachmentto being good people,we still make mistakes,and we make mistakesthat sometimes hurt other people,that sometimes promote injustice,despite our best attempts,and we explain away our mistakesrather than learning from them.Like, for example,when I got an emailfrom a female student in my classsaying that a reading I had assigned,a reading I had been assigning for years,was sexist.Or when I confusedtwo students in my classof the same race —look nothing alike —when I confused them for each othermore than once, in front of everybody.
These kinds of mistakes send us, send me,into red-zone defensiveness.They leave us fightingfor that good person identity.But the latest work that I've been doingon bounded ethicality with Mary Kernsays that we're notonly prone to mistakes —that tendency towards mistakes dependson how close we are to that red zone.So most of the time, nobody's challengingour good person identity,and so we're not thinking too muchabout the ethical implicationsof our decisions,and our model showsthat we're then spiralingtowards less and lessethical behavior most of the time.
On the other hand, somebodymight challenge our identity,or, upon reflection,we may be challenging it ourselves.So the ethical implicationsof our decisions become really salient,and in those cases, we spiral towardsmore and more good person behavior,or, to be more precise,towards more and more behaviorthat makes us feel like a good person,which isn't always the same, of course.The idea with bounded ethicalityis that we are perhaps overestimatingthe importance our inner compassis playing in our ethical decisions.We perhaps are overestimatinghow much our self-interestis driving our decisions,and perhaps we don't realizehow much our self-view as a good personis affecting our behavior,that in fact, we're working so hardto protect that good person identity,to keep out of that red zone,that we're not actually giving ourselvesspace to learn from our mistakesand actually be better people.
It's perhaps becausewe expect it to be easy.We have this definitionof good person that's either-or.Either you are a good personor you're not.Either you have integrity or you don't.Either you are a racist or a sexistor a homophobe or you're not.And in this either-or definition,there's no room to grow.And by the way,this is not what we doin most parts of our lives.Life, if you needed to learn accounting,you would take an accounting class,or if you become a parent,we pick up a book and we read about it.We talk to experts,we learn from our mistakes,we update our knowledge,we just keep getting better.But when it comes to being a good person,we think it's somethingwe're just supposed to know,we're just supposed to do,without the benefit of effort or growth.
So what I've been thinking aboutis what if we were to just forgetabout being good people,just let it go,and instead, set a higher standard,a higher standardof being a good-ish person?A good-ish personabsolutely still makes mistakes.As a good-ish person,I'm making them all the time.But as a good-ish person,I'm trying to learn from them, own them.I expect them and I go after them.I understand there are coststo these mistakes.When it comes to issues like ethicsand bias and diversity and inclusion,there are real costs to real people,and I accept that.As a good-ish person, in fact,I become betterat noticing my own mistakes.I don't wait for people to point them out.I practice finding them,and as a result ...Sure, sometimes it can be embarrassing,it can be uncomfortable.We put ourselvesin a vulnerable place, sometimes.But through all that vulnerability,just like in everything elsewe've tried to ever get better at,we see progress.We see growth.We allow ourselves to get better.
Why wouldn't we give ourselves that?In every other part of our lives,we give ourselves room to grow —except in this one, where it matters most.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Do you remember when you were a child,you probably had a favorite toythat was a constant companion,like Christopher Robinhad Winnie the Pooh,and your imaginationfueled endless adventures?What could be more innocent than that?Well, let me introduce youto my friend Cayla.
Cayla was voted toy of the yearin countries around the world.She connects to the internetand uses speech recognition technologyto answer your child's questions,respond just like a friend.But the power doesn't liewith your child's imagination.It actually lies with the companyharvesting masses of personal informationwhile your family is innocentlychatting away in the safety of their home,a dangerously false sense of security.This case sounded alarm bells for me,as it is my job to protectconsumers' rights in my country.And with billions of devices such as cars,energy meters and even vacuum cleanersexpected to come online by 2020,we thought this was a caseworth investigating further.Because what was Cayla doingwith all the interesting thingsshe was learning?Did she have another friend she wasloyal to and shared her information with?Yes, you guessed right. She did.In order to play with Cayla,you need to download an appto access all her features.Parents must consent to the termsbeing changed without notice.The recordings of the child,her friends and family,can be used for targeted advertising.And all this information can be sharedwith unnamed third parties.
Enough? Not quite.Anyone with a smartphonecan connect to Caylawithin a certain distance.When we confronted the companythat made and programmed Cayla,they issued a series of statementsthat one had to be an IT expertin order to breach the security.Shall we fact-check that statementand live hack Cayla together?Here she is.Cayla is equipped with a Bluetooth devicewhich can transmit up to 60 feet,a bit less if there's a wall between.That means I, or any stranger,can connect to the dollwhile being outside the roomwhere Cayla and her friends are.And to illustrate this,I'm going to turn Cayla on now.Let's see, one, two, three.There. She's on. And I asked a colleagueto stand outside with his smartphone,and he's connected,and to make this a bit creepier ...
(Laughter)
let's see what kids could hear Cayla sayin the safety of their room.
Man: Hi. My name is Cayla. What is yours?
Finn Myrstad: Uh, Finn.
Man: Is your mom close by?
FM: Uh, no, she's in the store.
Man: Ah. Do you wantto come out and play with me?
FM: That's a great idea.
Man: Ah, great.
FM: I'm going to turn Cayla off now.
(Laughter)
We needed no passwordor to circumvent any othertype of security to do this.We published a reportin 20 countries around the world,exposing this significant security flawand many other problematic issues.So what happened?Cayla was banned in Germany,taken off the shelvesby Amazon and Wal-Mart,and she's now peacefully restingat the German Spy Museum in Berlin.
(Laughter)
However, Cayla was also for salein stores around the worldfor more than a yearafter we published our report.What we uncovered is thatthere are few rules to protect usand the ones we haveare not being properly enforced.We need to get the securityand privacy of these devices rightbefore they enter the market,because what is the pointof locking a house with a keyif anyone can enter itthrough a connected device?
You may well think,"This will not happen to me.I will just stay awayfrom these flawed devices."But that won't keep you safe,because simply byconnecting to the internet,you are put in an impossibletake-it-or-leave-it position.
Let me show you.Like most of you,I have dozens of apps on my phone,and used properly,they can make our lives easier,more convenient and maybe even healthier.But have we been lulledinto a false sense of security?It starts simply by ticking a box.Yes, we say,I've read the terms.But have you really read the terms?Are you sure they didn't look too longand your phone was running out of battery,and the last time you triedthey were impossible to understand,and you needed to use the service now?And now, the powerimbalance is established,because we have agreedto our personal informationbeing gathered and usedon a scale we could never imagine.
This is why my colleagues and Idecided to take a deeper look at this.We set out to read the termsof popular apps on an average phone.And to show the worldhow unrealistic it isto expect consumersto actually read the terms,we printed them,more than 900 pages,and sat down in our officeand read them out loud ourselves,streaming the experimentlive on our websites.As you can see, it took quite a long time.It took us 31 hours,49 minutes and 11 secondsto read the terms on an average phone.That is longer than a movie marathonof the "Harry Potter" moviesand the "Godfather" movies combined.
(Laughter)
And reading is one thing.Understanding is another story.That would have taken usmuch, much longer.And this is a real problem,because companies have arguedfor 20 to 30 yearsagainst regulating the internet better,because users have consentedto the terms and conditions.
As we've shown with this experiment,achieving informed consentis close to impossible.Do you think it's fair to put the burdenof responsibility on the consumer?I don't.I think we should demandless take-it-or-leave-itand more understandable termsbefore we agree to them.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Now, I would like to tell youa story about love.Some of the world'smost popular apps are dating apps,an industry now worth more than,or close to, three billion dollars a year.And of course, we're OKsharing our intimate detailswith our other half.But who else is snooping,saving and sharing our informationwhile we are baring our souls?My team and I decided to investigate this.And in order to understandthe issue from all anglesand to truly do a thorough job,I realized I had to downloadone of the world'smost popular dating apps myself.
So I went home to my wife ...
(Laughter)
who I had just married."Is it OK if I establish a profileon a very popular dating appfor purely scientific purposes?"
(Laughter)
This is what we found.Hidden behind the main menuwas a preticked boxthat gave the dating company accessto all my personal pictures on Facebook,in my case more than 2,000 of them,and some were quite personal.And to make matters worse,when we read the terms and conditions,we discovered the following,and I'm going to need to take outmy reading glasses for this one.And I'm going to read it for you,because this is complicated.All right.
"By posting content" —and content refers to your pictures, chatand other interactionsin the dating service —"as a part of the service,you automatically grant to the company,its affiliates, licensees and successorsan irrevocable" — which meansyou can't change your mind —"perpetual" — which means forever —"nonexclusive, transferrable,sublicensable, fully paid-up,worldwide right and licenseto use, copy, store, perform,display, reproduce, record,play, adapt, modifyand distribute the content,prepare derivative works of the content,or incorporate the contentinto other worksand grant and authorize sublicensesof the foregoing in any medianow known or hereafter created."
That basically meansthat all your dating historyand everything related to itcan be used for any purpose for all time.Just imagine your childrenseeing your sassy dating photosin a birth control ad 20 years from now.
But seriously, though —
(Laughter)
what might these commercialpractices mean to you?For example, financial loss:based on your web browsing history,algorithms might decidewhether you will get a mortgage or not.Subconscious manipulation:companies can analyze your emotionsbased on your photos and chats,targeting you with adswhen you are at your most vulnerable.Discrimination:a fitness app can sell your datato a health insurance company,preventing you from gettingcoverage in the future.All of this is happeningin the world today.
But of course, not all usesof data are malign.Some are just flawed or need more work,and some are truly great.And there is some good news as well.The dating companieschanged their policies globallyafter we filed a legal complaint.But organizations such as minethat fight for consumers' rightscan't be everywhere.Nor can consumers fix this on their own,because if we knowthat something innocent we saidwill come back to haunt us,we will stop speaking.If we know that we are beingwatched and monitored,we will change our behavior.And if we can't control who has our dataand how it is being used,we have lost the control of our lives.
The stories I have told you todayare not random examples.They are everywhere,and they are a signthat things need to change.And how can we achieve that change?Well, companies need to realizethat by prioritizing privacy and security,they can build trustand loyalty to their users.Governments must create a safer internetby ensuring enforcementand up-to-date rules.And us, the citizens?We can use our voiceto remind the world that technologycan only truly benefit societyif it respects basic rights.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
So, let me thank youfor the opportunity to talk aboutthe biggest international storyof your professional lifetime,which is also the most importantinternational challengethe world will facefor as far as the eye can see.
The story, of course,is the rise of China.Never before have so many peoplerisen so far so fast,on so many different dimensions.The challenge is the impactof China's rise —the discombobulationthis will cause the Unites Statesand the international order,of which the US has beenthe principal architect and guardian.The past 100 years have been whathistorians now call an "American Century."Americans have becomeaccustomed to their placeat the top of every pecking order.So the very idea of another countrythat could be as big and strongas the US — or bigger —strikes many Americansas an assault on who they are.
For perspective on whatwe're now seeing in this rivalry,it's useful to locate iton the larger map of history.The past 500 years have seen 16 casesin which a rising powerthreatened to displace a ruling power.Twelve of those ended in war.So just in November, we'll all pauseto mark the 100th anniversaryof the final day of a warthat became so encompassing,that it required historians to createan entirely new category: world war.So, on the 11th hour of the 11th dayof the 11th month in 1918,the guns of World War I fell silent,but 20 million individuals lay dead.
I know that thisis a sophisticated audience,so you know about the rise of China.I'm going to focus, therefore,on the impact of China's rise,on the US, on the international orderand on the prospects for war and peace.But having taught at Harvardover many years,I've learned that from time to time,it's useful to take a short pause,just to make sure we're allon the same page.The way I do this is, I call a time-out,I give students a pop quiz —ungraded, of course.So, let's try this. Time-out, pop quiz.
Question:forty years ago, 1978, China sets outon its march to the market.At that point, what percentageof China's one billion citizenswere struggling to surviveon less than two dollars a day?Take a guess — 25 percent?Fifty?Seventy-five?Ninety.What do you think?Ninety.Nine out of every 10on less than two dollars a day.Twenty eighteen, 40 years later.What about the numbers?What's your bet?Take a look.Fewer than one in 100 today.And China's president has promisedthat within the next three years,those last tens of millionswill have been raised upabove that threshold.So it's a miracle, actually,in our lifetime.Hard to believe.But brute facts are even harder to ignore.A nation that didn't even appearon any of the international league tables25 years agohas soared,to rival — and in some areas,surpass — the United States.
Thus, the challengethat will shape our world:a seemingly unstoppable rising Chinaaccelerating towards an apparentlyimmovable ruling US,on course for what could bethe grandest collision in history.To help us get our mindsaround this challenge,I'm going to introduce youto a great thinker,I'm going to present a big idea,and I'm going to pose a mostconsequential question.The great thinker is Thucydides.Now, I know his name is a mouthful,and some peoplehave trouble pronouncing it.So, let's do it, one,two, three, together:Thucydides.One more time: Thucydides.
So who was Thucydides?He was the father and founder of history.He wrote the first-ever history book.It's titled "The Historyof the Peloponnesian War,"about the war in Greece, 2500 years ago.So if nothing else today,you can tweet your friends,"I met a great thinker.And I can even pronouncehis name: Thucydides."So, about this warthat destroyed classical Greece,Thucydides wrote famously:"It was the rise of Athensand the fear that this instilled in Spartathat made the war inevitable."So the rise of oneand the reaction of the othercreate a toxic cocktail of pride,arrogance, paranoia,that drug them both to war.
Which brings me to the big idea:Thucydides's Trap."Thucydides's Trap" is a termI coined several years ago,to make vivid Thucydides's insight.Thucydides's Trap is the dangerousdynamic that occurswhen a rising power threatensto displace a ruling power,like Athens —or Germany 100 years ago,or China today —and their impact on Sparta,or Great Britain 100 years ago,or the US today.As Henry Kissinger has said,once you get this idea, this conceptof Thucydides's Trap in your head,it will provide a lensfor helping you look throughthe news and noise of the dayto understand what's actually going on.
So, to the most consequential questionabout our world today:Are we going to followin the footsteps of history?Or can we, through a combinationof imagination and common senseand couragefind a way to manage this rivalrywithout a war nobody wants,and everybody knows would be catastrophic?Give me five minutes to unpack this,and later this afternoon, when the nextnews story pops up for youabout China doing this,or the US reacting like that,you will be able to have a betterunderstanding of what's going onand even to explain it to your friends.
So as we saw with this flippingthe pyramid of poverty,China has actually soared.It's meteoric.Former Czech president, Vaclav Havel,I think, put it best.He said, "All this has happened so fast,we haven't yet had time to be astonished."
(Laughter)
To remind myselfhow astonished I should be,I occasionally look out the windowin my office in Cambridgeat this bridge, which goesacross the Charles River,between the Kennedy Schooland Harvard Business School.In 2012, the State of Massachusetts saidthey were going to renovate this bridge,and it would take two years.In 2014, they said it wasn't finished.In 2015, they saidit would take one more year.In 2016, they said it's not finished,we're not going to tell youwhen it's going to be finished.Finally, last year, it was finished —three times over budget.
Now, compare this to a similar bridgethat I drove across last month in Beijing.It's called the Sanyuan Bridge.In 2015, the Chinese decidedthey wanted to renovate that bridge.It actually has twice as manylanes of traffic.How long did it take for themto complete the project?Twenty fifteen, what do you bet?Take a guess — OK, three —Take a look.
(Laughter)
The answer is 43 hours.
(Audience: Wow!)
(Laughter)
Graham Allison: Now, of course,that couldn't happen in New York.
(Laughter)
Behind this speed in executionis a purpose-driven leaderand a government that works.The most ambitiousand most competent leaderon the international stage todayis Chinese President Xi Jinping.And he's made no secretabout what he wants.As he said when he becamepresident six years ago,his goal is to make China great again —
(Laughter)
a banner he raised long beforeDonald Trump picked up a version of this.To that end, Xi Jinping has announcedspecific targets for specific dates:2025, 2035, 2049.
By 2025, China means to bethe dominant powerin the major marketin 10 leading technologies,including driverless cars, robots,artificial intelligence,quantum computing.By 2035, China means to bethe innovation leaderacross all the advanced technologies.And by 2049, which isthe 100th anniversaryof the founding of the People's Republic,China means to beunambiguously number one,including, says] Xi Jinping,an army that he calls "Fight and Win."So these are audacious goals,but as you can see,China is already well on its wayto these objectives.And we should rememberhow fast our world is changing.Thirty years ago,the World Wide Web had notyet even been invented.Who will feel the impactof this rise of China most directly?Obviously, the current number one.As China gets biggerand stronger and richer,technologically more advanced,it will inevitably bump up againstAmerican positions and prerogatives.
Now, for red-blooded Americans —and especially for red-necked Americanslike me; I'm from North Carolina —there's something wrong with this picture.The USA means number one,that's who we are.But again, to repeat:brute facts are hard to ignore.Four years ago, Senator John McCainasked me to testify about thisto his Senate Armed Services Committee.And I made for them a chartthat you can see,that said, compare the US and Chinato kids on opposite endsof a seesaw on a playground,each represented by the sizeof their economy.As late as 2004,China was just half our size.By 2014, its GDP was equal to ours.And on the current trajectory,by 2024, it will be half again larger.The consequences of this tectonic changewill be felt everywhere.
For example, in the currenttrade conflict,China is alreadythe number one trading partnerof all the major Asian countries.Which brings us backto our Greek historian.Harvard's "Thucydides's Trap Case File"has reviewed the last 500 years of historyand found 16 cases in which a rising powerthreatened to displace a ruling power.Twelve of these ended in war.And the tragedy of thisis that in very few of thesedid either of the protagonists want a war;few of these wars were initiatedby either the rising poweror the ruling power.
So how does this work?What happens is,a third party's provocationforces one or the other to react,and that sets in motion a spiral,which drags the two somewherethey don't want to go.If that seems crazy, it is.But it's life.Remember World War I.The provocation in that casewas the assassinationof a second-level figure,Archduke Franz Ferdinand,which then ledthe Austro-Hungarian emperorto issue an ultimatum to Serbia,they dragged in the various allies,within two months,all of Europe was at war.
So imagine if Thucydides were watchingplanet Earth today.What would he say?Could he find a more appropriateleading man for the ruling powerthan Donald J Trump?
(Laughter)
Or a more apt lead for the risingpower than Xi Jinping?And he would scratch his headand certainly say he couldn't thinkof more colorful provocateurthan North Korea's Kim Jong-un.Each seems determinedto play his assigned partand is right on script.
So finally, we conclude againwith the most consequential question,the question that will havethe gravest consequencesfor the rest of our lives:Are Americans and Chinese going to letthe forces of history drive us to a warthat would be catastrophic for both?Or can we summonthe imagination and courageto find a way to survive together,to share the leadershipin the 21st century,or, as Xi Jinping said], to createa new form of great power relations?
That's the issue I've beenpursuing passionatelyfor the last two years.I've had the opportunity to talkand, indeed, to listento leaders of allthe relevant governments —Beijing, Washington, Seoul, Tokyo —and to thought leaders across the spectrumof both the arts and business.I wish I had more to report.The good news is that leadersare increasingly awareof this Thucydidean dynamicand the dangers that it poses.The bad news is thatnobody has a feasible planfor escaping history as usual.
So it's clear to methat we need some ideasoutside the boxof conventional state graph —indeed, from another pageor another space —which is what brings me to TED todayand which brings me to a request.This audience includes manyof the most creative minds on the planet,who get up in the morning and thinknot only about how to managethe world we have,but how to create worlds that should be.So I'm hopeful that as this sinks inand as you reflect on it,some of you are going to havesome bold ideas, actually some wild ideas,that when we find, will makea difference in this space.And just to remind you if you do,this won't be the first time.
Let me remind you of what happenedright after World War II.A remarkable group of Americansand Europeans and others,not just from government, but fromthe world of culture and business,engaged in a collectivesurge of imagination.And what they imaginedand what they createdwas a new international order,the order that's allowed you and meto live our lives, all of our lives,without great power warand with more prosperitythan was ever seen before on the planet.So, a remarkable story.Interestingly, every pillar of thisproject that produced these results,when first proposed,was rejected by the foreignpolicy establishmentas naive or unrealistic.
My favorite is the Marshall Plan.After World War II,Americans felt exhausted.They had demobilized 10 million troops,they were focused onan urgent domestic agenda.But as people began to appreciatehow devastated Europe wasand how aggressive Soviet communism was,Americans eventually decidedto tax themselvesa percent and a half of GDPevery year for four yearsand send that money to Europeto help reconstruct these countries,including Germany and Italy,whose troops had justbeen killing Americans.Amazing.This also created the United Nations.Amazing.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.The World Bank.NATO.All of these elements of an orderfor peace and prosperity.So, in a word, what we needto do is do it again.And I think now we need a surgeof imagination, creativity,informed by history,for, as the philosopherSantayana reminded us,in the end, only thosewho refuse to study historyare condemned to repeat it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Bryn Freedman: So you saidthat in the 20th century,global power was in the handsof government.At the beginning of this digital century,it really moved to corporationsand that in the future,it would move to individuals.And I've interviewed a lot of people,and they say you're wrong,and they are betting on the companies.So why are you right,and why are individuals going to win out?
Fadi Chehadé: Because companiescater to individuals,and we as the citizenryneed to start understandingthat we have a big rolein shaping how the worldwill be governed, moving forward.Yes, indeed, the tug of war right nowis between governments,who lost much of their power to companiesbecause the internet is not builtaround the nation-state systemaround which governments have power.The internet is transnational.It's not international,and it's not national,and therefore the companiesbecame very powerful.They shape our economy.They shape our society.Governments don't know what to do.Right now, they're reacting.And I fear that if we do not,as the citizenry —which are, in my opinion,the most important leg of that stool —don't take our role,then you are right.The detractors, or the people telling youthat businesses will prevail, are right.It will happen.
BF: So are you saying that individualswill force businessesor business will be forcedto be responsive,or is there a fear that they won't be?
FC: I think they will be.Look at two weeks ago,a small company called Skipwinning over Uber and Lyft and everyoneto actually get the licensefor the San Francisco scooter business.And if you read why did Skip win,because Skip listenedto the people of San Francisco,who were tired of scootersbeing thrown everywhere,and actually went to the city and said,"We will deploy the service,but we will respondto the people's requirementsthat we organize ourselvesaround a set of rules."They self-governed their behavior,and they won the contractover some very powerful companies.
BF: So speaking of guidelinesand self-governance,you've spent an entire lifetimecreating guidelines and normsfor the internet.Do you think those days are over?Who is going to guide,who is going to control,and who is going to create those norms?
FC: The rules that governthe technology layers of the internetare now well put in place,and I was very busy for a few yearssetting those rulesaround the part of the internetthat makes the internet one network.The domain-name system, the IP numbers,all of that is in place.However, as we get nowinto the upper layers of the internet,the issues that affectme and you every day —privacy, security, etc. —the system to create norms for thoseunfortunately is not in place.So we do have an issue.We have a systemof cooperation and governancethat really needs to be created right nowso that companies, governmentsand the citizenry can agreehow this new digital worldis going to advance.
BF: So what givesa digital company any incentive?Let's say — Facebook comes to mind —they would say they havetheir users' best interests at heart,but I think a lot of peoplewould disagree with that.
FC: It's been very difficult to watchhow tech companies have reactedto the citizenry's responseto their technologies.And some of them, two or three years ago,basically dismissed it.The word that I heard in many board roomsis, "We're just a technology platform.It's not my issueif my technology platformcauses familiesto go kill their girls in Pakistan.It's not my issue. It's their problem.I just have a technology platform."Now, I think we are now entering a stagewhere companies are starting to realizethis is no longer sustainable,and they're starting to see the pushbackthat's comingfrom people, users, citizens,but also governmentsthat are starting to say,"This cannot be."
So I think there is a maturitythat is starting to set,especially in that Silicon Valley area,where people are beginning to say,"We have a role."So when I speak to these leaders, I say,"Look, you could be the CEO,a very successful CEO of a company,but you could also be a steward."And that's the key word."You could be a stewardof the power you haveto shape the lives and the economiesof billions of people.Which one do you want to be?"And the answer is,it's not one or the other.This is what we are missing right now.So when an adult like Brad Smith,the president of Microsoft,said a few months ago,"We need a new set of Geneva Conventionsto manage the securityof the digital space,"many of the senior leadersin Silicon Valleyactually spoke against his words."What do you mean, Geneva Convention?We don't need any Geneva Conventions.We self-regulate."But that mood is changing,and I'm starting to see many leaders say,"Help us out."But here lies the conundrum.Who is going to help those leadersdo the right thing?
BF: So who is going to help them?Because I'd loveto interview you for an hour,but give me your biggest fearand your best hopefor how this is going to work out.
FC: My biggest hopeis that we will become each stewardsof this new digital world.That's my biggest hope,because I do think, often,we want to put the blame on others."Oh, it's these CEOs.They're behaving this way.""These governments are not doing enough."But how about us?How is each of us actually takingthe responsibility to be a stewardof the digital space we live in?And one of the things I've been pushingon university presidentsis we need every engineering and scienceand computer science studentwho is about to writethe next line of codeor design the next IoT deviceto actually have in thema sense of responsibility and stewardshiptowards what they're building.So I suggested we create a new oath,like the Hippocratic Oath,so that every studententering an engineering programtakes a technocratic oath or a wisdom oathor some oath of commitmentto the rest of us.That's my best hope, that we all rise.Because governments and businesseswill fight over this power game,but where are we?And unless we play into that power table,I think we'll end up in a bad place.
My biggest fear?My biggest fear,to be very tactical today,what is keeping me up at nightis the current war betweenthe West, the liberal world,and China,in the area of artificial intelligence.There is a real war going on,and for those of us who have livedthrough the nuclear nonproliferation ageand saw how people agreedto take some very dangerousthings off the table,well, the Carnegie Endowmentjust finished a study.They talked to every countrythat made nuclear weaponsand asked them,"Which digital 'weapon'would you take off the tableagainst somebody else'sschools or hospitals?"And the answer —from every nuclear power —to this question was,nothing.That's what I'm worried about ...The weaponization of the digital space,and the race to get there.
BF: Well, it sounds likeyou've got a lot of work to do,and so do the rest of us.Fadi, thank you so much.I really appreciate it.
FC: Thank you.
(Applause)
How are we doing?No, no, no, by that, I meant,how are we, homo sapiens "we" ...
(Laughter)
doing as a species?
(Laughter)
Now the typical wayto answer that question is this.You choose some measureof human physical well-being:average longevity,average calories per day,average income, overall population,that sort of thing,and draw a graph of its value over time.In almost every case,you get the same result.The line skitters alongat a low level for millennia,then rockets up exponentiallyin the 19th and 20th century.Or choose a measure of consumption:consumption of energy,consumption of fresh water,consumption of the world's photosynthesis,and draw a graph of its value over time.In the same way, the line skitters alongat a low level for millennia,then rockets up exponentiallyin the 19th and 20th century.
Biologists have a word for this: outbreak.An outbreak is whena population or speciesexceeds the bounds of natural selection.Natural selection ordinarilykeeps populations and specieswithin roughly defined limits.Pests, parasites, lack of resourcesprevent them from expanding too much.But every now and then,a species escapes its bounds.Crown-of-thorns starfishin the Indian Ocean,zebra mussels in the Great Lakes,spruce budworm here in Canada.Populations explode,a hundredfold, a thousandfold,a millionfold.So here's a fundamentallesson from biology:outbreaks in nature don't end well.
(Laughter)
Put a couple of protozoainto a petri dish full of nutrient goo.In their natural habitat, soil or water,their environment constrains them.In the petri dish, they havean ocean of breakfastand no natural enemies.They eat and reproduce, eat and reproduce,until bang, they hitthe edge of the petri dish,at which point they eitherdrown in their own waste,starve from lack of resources, or both.The outbreak ends, always, badly.
Now, from the viewpoint of biology,you and I are not fundamentally differentthan the protozoa in the petri dish.We're not special.All the things that we, in our vanity,think make us different —art, science, technology, and so forth,they don't matter.We're an outbreak species,we're going to hit the edgeof the petri dish, simple as that.
Well, the obvious question:Is this actually true?Are we in fact doomedto hit the edge of the petri dish?I'd like to set asidethis question for a momentand ask you guys another one.If we are going to escape biology,how are we going to do it?In the year 2050,there will be almost10 billion people in the world,and all of those people will wantthe things that you and I want:nice cars, nice clothes, nice homes,the odd chunk of Toblerone.I mean, think of it:Toblerone for 10 billion people.How are we going to do this?How are we going to feed everybody,get water to everybody,provide power to everybody,avoid the worst impacts of climate change?
I'm a science journalist,and I've been asking these questionsto researchers for years,and in my experience, their answersfall into two broad categories,which I call "wizards" and "prophets."Wizards, techno-whizzes,believe that science and technology,properly applied,will let us produceour way out of our dilemmas."Be smart, make more," they say."That way, everyone can win."Prophets believe close to the opposite.They see the world as governedby fundamental ecological processeswith limits that wetransgress to our peril."Use less, conserve," they say."Otherwise, everybody's going to lose."Wizards and prophets have beenbutting their heads together for decades,but they both believe that technologyis key to a successful future.The trouble is, they envisiondifferent types of technologyand different types of futures.
Wizards envision a world of glittering,hyperefficient megacitiessurrounded by vast tractsof untouched nature,economies that havetransitioned from atoms to bits,dematerialized capitalist societiesthat no longer dependon exploiting nature.Energy, to wizards,comes from compact nuclear plants;food from low-footprint farmswith ultraproductive,genetically modified cropstended by robots;water from high-throughputdesalination plants,which means we no longerexploit rivers and aquifers.Wizards envision all 10 billion of uspacked into ultradensebut walkable megacities,an urbanized worldof maximum human aspirationand maximum human liberty.
Now, prophets object to every bit of this.You can't dematerializefood and water, they point out.They say, you can't eat bits,and industrial agriculture has alreadygiven us massive soil erosion,huge coastal dead zonesand ruined soil microbiomes.And you wizards, you want more of this?And those giant desalination plants?You know they generateequally giant piles of toxic saltthat are basicallyimpossible to dispose of.And those megacities you like?Can you name mean actually existing megacitythat really exists in the world today,except for possibly Tokyo,that isn't a cesspoolof corruption and inequality?Instead, prophets pray for a worldof smaller, interconnected communities,closer to the earth,a more agrarian worldof maximum human connectionand reduced corporate control.More people livein the countryside in this vision,with power provided by neighborhood-scalesolar and wind installationsthat disappear into the background.Prophets don't generate waterfrom giant desalination plants.They capture it from rainfall,and they reuse and recycle it endlessly.And the food comesfrom small-scale networks of farmsthat focus on trees and tubersrather than less productive cerealslike wheat and rice.
Above all, though, prophets envisionpeople changing their habits.They don't drive to work,they take their renewable-powered train.They don't take 30-minutehot showers every morning.They eat, you know,like Michael Pollan says,real food, mostly plants, not too much.Above all, prophets saysubmitting to nature's restraintsleads to a freer, more democratic,healthier way of life.
Now, wizards regard all this as hooey.They see it as a recipe for narrowness,regression, and global poverty.Prophet-style agriculture, they say,only extends the human footprintand shunts more peopleinto low-wage agricultural labor.Those neighborhood-run solar facilities,they sound great,but they depend on a technologythat doesn't exist yet.They're a fantasy.And recycling water? It's a brakeon growth and development.Above all, though, wizards objectto the prophets' emphasison wide-scale social engineering,which they see as deeply anti-democratic.
If the history of the last two centurieswas one of unbridled growth,the history of the coming centurymay well be the choice we makeas a species between these two paths.These are the arguments that will beresolved, in one way or another,by our children's generation,the generation that will comeinto the world of 10 billion.
Now, but wait, by this point,biologists should be rolling their eyesso loud you can barely hear me speak.They should be saying,all of this, wizards, prophets,it's a pipe dream.It doesn't matter which illusory pathyou think you're taking.Outbreaks in nature don't end well.I mean, you think the protozoasee the edge of the petri dish approachingand say, "Hey guys,time to change society"?No. They just let her rip.That's what life does,and we're part of life.We'll do the same thing. Deal with it.
Well, if you're a follower of Darwin,you have to take this into consideration.I mean, the basic counterargumentboils down to: "We're special."How lame is that?
(Laughter)
I mean, we can accumulateand share knowledgeand use it to guide our future.Well, are we actually doing this?Is there any evidence that we're actuallyusing our accumulated, shared knowledgeto guarantee our long-term prosperity?It's pretty easy to say no.
If you're a wizard,and you believe that hyperproductive,genetically engineered cropsare key to feeding everyonein tomorrow's world,you have to worry that 20 yearsof scientists demonstratingthat they are safe to consumehas failed to convince the publicto embrace this technology.If you're a prophetand you believe that key to solvingtoday's growing shortage of fresh wateris to stop wasting it,you have to worrythat cities around the world,in rich places as well as poor,routinely lose a quarteror more of their waterto leaky and contaminated pipes.I mean, Cape Town, just a littlewhile ago, almost ran out of water.Cape Town loses a thirdof its water to leaky pipes.This problem has beengetting worse for decades,and remarkably littlehas been done about it.
If you're a wizard, and you thinkthat clean, abundant,carbon-free nuclear poweris key to fighting climate change,then you have to worrythat the public willingnessto build nukes is going down.If you're a prophet, and you thinkthat the solution to the same problemis these neighborhood-run solar facilitiesshuttling power back and forth,you have to worry that no nationanywhere in the worldhas devoted anything like the resourcesnecessary to develop this technologyand deploy it in the time that we need it.And if you're on either side,wizard or prophet,you have to worry that, despitethe massive alarm about climate change,the amount of energy generated every yearfrom fossil fuels has gone upby about 30 percentsince the beginning of this century.
So, still think we're differentthan the protozoa?Still think we're special?Actually, it's even worse than that.
(Laughter)
We're not in the streets.No seriously, if there's a differencebetween us and the protozoa,a difference that matters,it's not just our art and scienceand technology and so forth —it's that we can yell and scream,we can go out into the streets,and, over time,change the way society works,but we're not doing it.Wizards have been arguingliterally for decadesthat nuclear power is keyto resolving climate change.But the first pro-nuke march in historyoccurred less than two years ago,and it was dwarfed by the anti-nukemarches of the past.Prophets have been arguing,again literally for decades,that conservation is keyto keeping freshwater supplieswithout destroying the ecosystemsthat generate those freshwater supplies.But in the history of humankind,there has never been a streetfull of angry protesterswaving signs about leaky pipes.In fact, most of the politicalactivity in this spherehas been wizards and prophetsfighting each other, protesting each otherrather than recognizing that they are,fundamentally, on the same side.After all, these people are concernedabout the same thing:How are we going to make our wayin the world of 10 billion?
The first step towards generatingthat necessary social movement,creating that critical mass and gettingthat yelling and screaming goingseems obvious:wizards and prophets join together.But how are you going to do this,given the decades of hostility?
One way might be this:Each side agrees to acceptthe fundamental premises of the other.Accept that nuclear poweris safe and carbon-free,and that uranium minescan be hideously dirtyand that putting large volumesof toxic waste on rickety trainsand shuttling them aroundthe countryside is a terrible idea.To me, this leads rather quicklyto a vision of small,neighborhood scale, temporary nukes,nuclear power as a bridge technologywhile we develop and deploy renewables.Or accept that geneticallymodified crops are safeand that industrial agriculturehas caused huge environmental problems.To me, this leads rather quicklyto a vision of plant scientistsdevoting much more of their attentionto tree and tuber crops,which can be much moreproductive than cereals,use much less water than cereals,and cause much less erosion than cereals.
These are just ideasfrom a random journalist.I'm sure there's a hundred better onesright here in this room.The main point is,wizards and prophets working togetherhave many paths to success.And success would meanmuch more than mere survival,important though that is.I mean, if humankind somehowsurvives its own outbreak,if we get food to everybody,get water to everybody,get power to everybody,if we avoid the worst effectsof climate change,if we somehow safeguard the biome,it would be amazing.It would say, I think,even to a hardened cynic like me,maybe we really are special.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So two weeks ago, I searchedthe word "nationalist" on Twitter.The results were quite colorful,with expressions like,"Emboldened Racist Moron," —
(Laughter)
"White Supremacist Idiot,""Fascist Sock Puppets," —
(Laughter)
"Orwellian, Hitlerian, Terrifying."I then searched the word "globalist"and got things like,"Socialist Sell-Outs,""Disgusting Corporate Propaganda,""Elitist Financial Overlords,""Ruthless Cosmopolitan Rats."
(Laughter)
Even by social media standards,the words are cruel and disgusting.But they reflect the intensityof one of the most fundamental questionsof our times:Nationalism or globalism —what is the best path forward?This question impactseverything we care about:our cultural identity,our prosperity,our political systems —everything — the healthof our planet — everything.
So on the one hand, we have nationalism.Collins defines it asa "devotion to one's nation,"but also, a "doctrine that putsnational interestsabove international considerations."For nationalists, our modern societiesare built on national grounds:we share a land, a history, a culture,and we defend each other.In a big and chaotic world,they see nationalism as the onlysensible way to maintain social stability.But alarmed globalists warn us:self-centered nationalismcan easily turn ugly.We've seen it with 20th-century fascisms:bloody wars, millions of deaths,immeasurable destruction.
On the other hand, we have globalism.The Oxford Living Dictionarydefines it as:"the operation or planningof economic and foreign policyon a global basis."For nationalists, globalismis rapidly deconstructingwhat our ancestors took decades to build.It's like spitting on our soldiers' tombs;it's eroding our national solidaritiesand opening the doorsto foreign invasions.But globalists make the casethat reinforcing our global governanceis the only way to tacklebig supernational problems,like nuclear proliferation,the global refugee crisis,climate change or terrorismor even the consequences of superhuman AI.So we are at the crossroads,and we are asked to choose:nationalism or globalism?
Having lived in four continents,I've always been interestedin this question.But it took a whole new levelwhen I saw this happening:the biggest surge in nationalist votesin Western democraciessince World War II.All of a sudden,this isn't theory anymore.I mean, these political movementshave built their success with ideasthat could mean, down the road,losing my French citizenshipbecause I'm North Africanor not being able to comeback home to the USbecause I come froma Muslim-majority country.
You know, when you live in a democracy,you live with this idea thatyour government will always protect you,as long as you abide by the laws.With the rise of national populism,despite being the best citizen I can,I now have to live with the ideathat my government can hurt mefor reasons I cannot control.It's very unsettling.But it forced me to rethinkand rethink this questionand try to think deeper.And the more I thought about it,the more I startedquestioning the question.Why would we have to choosebetween nationalism and globalism,between loving our countryand caring for the world?There's no reason for that.We don't have to choosebetween family and countryor region or religion and country.We already have multiple identities,and we live with them very well.Why would we have to choosebetween country and world?What if, instead of acceptingthis absurd choice,we took it on ourselves to fightthis dangerous, binary thinking?
So for all the globalists in the audience,I want to ask:When I say the word "nationalist,"what image comes to your mind?Something like this?Believe me, I think of that, too.But I'd like you to rememberthat for most people,nationalism feels more like this.Or maybe like that.You know, it's that thing inside youwhen you accidentally watchan obscure Olympic sport on TV —
(Laughter)
wait —and the mere sight of an unknown athletewearing your national colorsgets you all excited.Your heartbeat goes up,your stress level goes up,and you're standing in front of the TVand screaming with passionfor that athlete to win.That's nationalism.It's people happy to be together,happy to belong to a largenational community.Why would it be wrong?
You know, globalists,you may think of nationalismas an old, 19th-century ideathat is destined to fade.But I'm sorry to tell youthat the facts are not on your side.When the World Values Surveyasked more than 89,000 peopleacross 60 countrieshow proud they felt about their country,88.5 percent said "very proud"or "quite proud" —88.5 percent.Nationalism is notgoing away anytime soon.It's a powerful feelingthat, according to another study,is a strong predictorof individual happiness.It's crazy, but your happiness is morecorrelated with national satisfactionthan with things you would expect,like household incomeor your job satisfactionor your health satisfaction.So if nationalism makes people happy,why would anybody take it away from them?
Fellow globalists, if you are like me,you may be attached to globalizationfor humanistic reasons.And you may take great joyin some of its accomplishments since 1945.After all, major regions of the worldhave been exceptionally peaceful;extreme poverty rates aroundthe globe are trending down;and more than two billion people,most notably in Asia,show spectacular improvementsin their standards of living.But studies also showthat globalization has a dark side.And left on the side of the roadare hundreds of millions of peoplein Western middle classeswith anemic income growthfor more than two decades,possibly three decades,according to some studies.We cannot ignorethis elephant in our room.If anything, our collective energywould be better usedfinding ways to fix this aspectof globalization,instead of fighting this polarizing battleagainst nationalism.
So now, the nationalists in the audience,I have some crusty,nonbinary nuggets for you.
(Laughter)
When I say the word "globalist,"what comes to your mind?Out-of-touch, one-percent plutocrats?
(Laughter)
Or maybe the heartless,greedy Wall Street type, right?Or maybe people like me,with multiple origins,living in a big, cosmopolitan metropolis.
Well, you remember that WorldValues Survey that I mentioned earlier?It showed another fascinating finding:71 percent of the world populationagreed with the statement,"I am a citizen of the world."Do you know what it means?Most of us are simultaneouslyproud of our countryand citizens of the world.And it gets even better.The citizens of the world in the surveyshow a higher level of national pridethan the ones that rejected that label.So once and for all, being a globalistdoesn't mean betraying your country.It just means that you haveenough social empathy,and you project some of it outsideyour national borders.
Now, I know that when I diginto my own nationalist feelings,one of my anxieties versusthe globalized worldis national identity:How are we going to preservewhat makes us special,what makes us different,what brings us together?And as I started thinking about it,I realized something really strange,which is that a lot of the key ingredientsof our national identitiesactually come from outsideour national borders.Like, think of the lettersthat we use every day.I don't know if you realize,but the Latin script, the Latinalphabet that we usehas its origins thousands of years ago,near the Nile River.It all started with a cow just like this,that was captured by a scribeinto an elegant hieroglyph.That hieroglyph was transcribedby a Semite in the Sinaiinto the letter aleph.Aleph traveled with Phoeniciansand reached the European shores in Greece,where it became alpha,the mother of our letter A.So that's how an Egyptian cowbecame our letter A.
(Laughter)
And same thing with the Egyptian housethat became bet, beta and B.And the Egyptian fishthat became daleth, delta and D.Our most fundamental textsare full of Egyptian cows,houses and fish.
(Laughter)
And there are so many other examples.Take the United Kingdom and its monarchy.Queen Elizabeth II?German ancestry.The mottos on the royal coat of arms?All written in French,not a single word of English.Take France and it's iconic Eiffel Tower.The inspiration?The United States of America —and I don't mean Las Vegas,I mean 19th-century New York.
(Laughter)
This was the tallest buildingin New York in the mid-19th century.Does it remind you of something?And you may think of Chinaas a self-contained civilization,protected behind its Great Wall.But think twice.The Chinese official ideology?Marxism, made in Germany.One of China's biggest religions?Buddhism, imported from India.India's favorite pastime?Cricket.I really love this quote from Ashis Nandy,who said, "Cricket is an Indian gameaccidentally discovered by the British."
(Laughter)
So these are good reminders that a lotof what we love in our national traditionsactually come from previouswaves of globalization.And beyond individual symbols,there are whole national traditionsthat could not have existedwithout globalization.And the example that comes to my mindis a world-beloved national tradition:Italian cuisine.My friends, if you ever have a chanceto go to a superauthenticItalian restaurantthat only serves ancient Roman recipes,my advice for you is: don't go.
(Laughter)
You'd get very, very disappointed.No spaghetti, no pasta —that really started in Sicilyin the eighth century,when it was under Arabian rule.No perfect espresso,no creamy cappuccino —that came from Abyssiniavia Yemen in the 17th century.And of course,no perfect pizza Napoletana —how would you make it withoutthe tomatoes of the New World?No, instead, you would be servedprobably a lot of porridge,some vegetable — mostlycabbage — some cheese,and maybe if you're lucky,the absolute delicacy of that time —mmm, perfectly cooked fattened dormice.
(Laughter)
Thankfully, it was not a close traditionpreserved by fanatic watchdogs.No, it was an open process,nourished by explorers, traders,street sellers and innovative home cooks.And in many ways,globalization is a chancefor our national traditions to bequestioned, regenerated, reinterpreted,to attract new convertsto stay vibrant and relevant over time.
So just remember this:most of us nationalistsin the world are globalists,and most of us globalistsin the world are nationalists.A lot of what we likein our national traditionscome from outside our national borders.And the reason we ventureoutside our national bordersis to discover these othernational traditions.So the real question should not beto choose betweennationalism and globalism.The real questions is:How can we do both better?It's a complex questionfor a complex worldthat calls for creative,nonbinary solutions.
What are you waiting for?
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'd like you allto close your eyes, please ...and imagine yourself sittingin the middle of a large, open fieldwith the sun setting on your right.And as the sun sets,imagine that tonightyou don't just see the stars appear,but you're able to hear the stars appearwith the brightest starsbeing the loudest notesand the hotter, bluer starsproducing the higher-pitched notes.
(Music)
And since each constellationis made up of different types of stars,they'll each producetheir own unique melody,such as Aries, the ram.
(Music)
Or Orion, the hunter.
(Music)
Or even Taurus, the bull.
(Music)
We live in a musical universe,and we can use that to experienceit from a new perspective,and to share that perspectivewith a wider range of people.Let me show you what I mean.
(Music ends)
Now, when I tell peopleI'm an astrophysicist,they're usually pretty impressed.And then I say I'm also a musician —they're like, "Yeah, we know."
(Laughter)
So everyone seems to knowthat there's this deep connectionbetween music and astronomy.And it's actually a very old idea;it goes back over 2,000 yearsto Pythagoras.You might remember Pythagorasfrom such theoremsas the Pythagorean theorem —
(Laughter)
And he said:"There is geometryin the humming of the strings,there is music in the spacingof the spheres."And so he literally thoughtthat the motions of the planetsalong the celestial spherecreated harmonious music.And if you asked him,"Why don't we hear anything?"he'd say you can't hear itbecause you don't knowwhat it's like to not hear it;you don't know what true silence is.It's like how you have to waitfor your power to go outto hear how annoyingyour refrigerator was.Maybe you buy that,but not everybody else was buying it,including such names as Aristotle.
(Laughter)
Exact words.
(Laughter)
So I'll paraphrase his exact words.He said it's a nice idea,but if something as large and vastas the heavens themselveswere moving and making sounds,it wouldn't just be audible,it would be earth-shatteringly loud.We exist, thereforethere is no music of the spheres.He also thought that the brain'sonly purpose was to cool down the blood,so there's that ...
(Laughter)
But I'd like to show you that in some waythey were actually both right.And we're going to start by understandingwhat makes music musical.It may sound like a silly question,but have you ever wondered why it isthat certain notes, when played together,sound relatively pleasing or consonant,such as these two —
(Music)
while others area lot more tense or dissonant,such as these two.
(Music)
Right?Why is that? Why are there notes at all?Why can you be in or out of tune?Well, the answer to that questionwas actually solved by Pythagoras himself.Take a look at the string on the far left.If you bow that string,it will produce a note as it oscillatesvery fast back and forth.
(Musical note)
But now if you cut the string in half,you'll get two strings,each oscillating twice as fast.And that will produce a related note.Or three times as fast,or four times —
(Musical notes)
And so the secret to musical harmonyreally is simple ratios:the simpler the ratio,the more pleasing or consonantthose two notes will sound together.And the more complex the ratio,the more dissonant they will sound.And it's this interplaybetween tension and release,or consonance and dissonance,that makes what we call music.
(Music)
(Music ends)
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
But there's more.
(Laughter)
So the two features of musicwe like to think of as pitch and rhythms,they're actually two versionsof the same thing,and I can show you.
(Slow rhythm)
That's a rhythm right?Watch what happens when we speed it up.
(Rhythm gets gradually faster)
(High pitch)
(Lowering pitch)
(Slow Rhythm)
So once a rhythm starts happeningmore than about 20 times per second,your brain flips.It stops hearing it as a rhythmand starts hearing it as a pitch.
So what does this have to dowith astronomy?Well, that's when we getto the TRAPPIST-1 system.This is an exoplanetary systemdiscovered last February of 2017,and it got everyone excitedbecause it is seven Earth-sized planetsall orbiting a very near red dwarf star.And we think that three of the planetshave the right temperaturefor liquid water.It's also so closethat in the next few years,we should be able to detectelements in their atmospheressuch as oxygen and methane —potential signs of life.But one thing aboutthe TRAPPIST system is that it is tiny.So here we have the orbitsof the inner rocky planetsin our solar system:Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,and all seven Earth-sizedplanets of TRAPPIST-1are tucked well insidethe orbit of Mercury.I have to expand this by 25 timesfor you to see the orbitsof the TRAPPIST-1 planets.It's actually much more similar in sizeto our planet Jupiter and its moons,even though it's sevenEarth-size planets orbiting a star.
Another reason this got everyone excitedwas artist renderings like this.You got some liquid water,some ice, maybe some land,maybe you can go for a divein this amazing orange sunset.It got everyone excited,and then a few months later,some other papers came outthat said, actually,it probably looks more like this.
(Laughter)
So there were signsthat some of the surfacesmight actually be molten lavaand that there were very damagingX-rays coming from the central star —X-rays that will sterilize the surfaceof life and even strip off atmospheres.Luckily, just a few months ago in 2018,some new papers came outwith more refined measurements,and they found actuallyit does look something like that.
(Laughter)
So we now know that several of themhave huge supplies of water —global oceans —and several of themhave thick atmospheres,so it's the right place to lookfor potential life.But there's something even moreexciting about this system,especially for me.And that's that TRAPPIST-1is a resonant chain.And so that means for every two orbitsof the outer planet,the next one in orbits three times,and the next one in four,and then six, nine, 15 and 24.So you see a lot of very simple ratiosamong the orbits of these planets.Clearly, if you speed up their motion,you can get rhythms, right?One beat, say, for every timea planet goes around.But now we know if you speedthat motion up even more,you'll actually produce musical pitches,and in this case alone,those pitches will work together,making harmonious,even human-like harmony.
So let's hear TRAPPIST-1.The first thing you'll hear will bea note for every orbit of each planet,and just keep in mind,this music is comingfrom the system itself.I'm not creating the pitches or rhythms,I'm just bringing theminto the human hearing range.And after all seven planets have entered,you're going to see —well, you're going to hear a drumfor every time two planets align.That's when they kind ofget close to each otherand give each other a gravitational tug.
(Tone)
(Two tones)
(Three tones)
(Four tones)
(Five tones)
(Six tones)
(Seven tones)
(Drum beats)
(Music ends)
And that's the sound of the star itself —its light converted into sound.
So you may wonderhow this is even possible.And it's good to thinkof the analogy of an orchestra.When everyone gets togetherto start playing in an orchestra,they can't just dive into it, right?They have to all get in tune;they have to make suretheir instruments resonatewith their neighbors' instruments,and something very similar happenedto TRAPPIST-1 early in its existence.When the planets were first forming,they were orbiting within a disc of gas,and while inside that disc,they can actually slide aroundand adjust their orbits to their neighborsuntil they're perfectly in tune.And it's a good thing they didbecause this system is so compact —a lot of mass in a tight space —if every aspect of their orbitswasn't very finely tuned,they would very quicklydisrupt each other's orbits,destroying the whole system.So it's really musicthat is keeping this system alive —and any of its potential inhabitants.
But what does our solar system sound like?I hate to be the one to show you this,but it's not pretty.
(Laughter)
So for one thing,our solar systemis on a much, much larger scale,and so to hear all eight planets,we have to start with Neptunenear the bottom of our hearing range,and then Mercury's goingto be all the way upnear the very top of our hearing range.But also, since our planetsare not very compact —they're very spread out —they didn't have to adjusttheir orbits to each other,so they're kind of just all playingtheir own random note at random times.So, I'm sorry, but here it is.
(Tone)
That's Neptune.
(Two tones)
Uranus.
(Three tones)
Saturn.
(Four tones)
Jupiter.And then tucked in, that's Mars.
(Five tones)
(Six tones)
Earth.
(Seven tones)
Venus.
(Eight tones)
And that's Mercury —OK, OK, I'll stop.
(Laughter)
So this was actually Kepler's dream.Johannes Kepler is the personthat figured outthe laws of planetary motion.He was completely fascinated by this ideathat there's a connectionbetween music, astronomy and geometry.And so he actually spent an entire bookjust searching for any kind of musicalharmony amongst the solar system's planetsand it was really, really hard.It would have been much easierhad he lived on TRAPPIST-1,or for that matter ...K2-138.This is a new systemdiscovered in January of 2018with five planets,and just like TRAPPIST,early on in their existence,they were all finely tuned.They were actually tunedinto a tuning structureproposed by Pythagoras himself,over 2,000 years before.But the system's actuallynamed after Kepler,discovered by the Kepler space telescope.And so, in the last few billion years,they've actually lost their tuning,quite a bit more than TRAPPIST has,and so what we're going to dois go back in timeand imagine whatthey would've sounded likejust as they were forming.
(Music)
(Music ends)
(Applause)
Thank you.
Now, you may be wondering:How far does this go?How much music actually is out there?And that's what I was wondering last fallwhen I was workingat U of T's planetarium,and I was contacted by an artistnamed Robyn Rennie and her daughter Erin.Robyn loves the night sky,but she hasn't been ableto fully see it for 13 yearsbecause of vision loss.And so they wonderedif there was anything I could do.So I collected all the soundsI could think of from the universeand packaged them intowhat became "Our Musical Universe."This is a sound-based planetarium showexploring the rhythmand harmony of the cosmos.And Robyn was so movedby this presentationthat when she went home,she painted this gorgeousrepresentation of her experience.And then I defaced itby putting Jupiter on it for the poster.
(Laughter)
So ...in this show, I take peopleof all vision levelsand bring them on an audio tourof the universe,from the night sky all the way outto the edge of the observable universe.But even this is just the startof a musical odysseyto experience the universewith new eyes and with new ears,and I hope you'll join me.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In 2015, we saw two fantastic,hopeful breakthroughs for humanity.First, the adoption ofthe Sustainable Development Goals,the collective, universalplan for humanityto eradicate hunger,promote] good economicdevelopment and good health,within global environmental targets.Secondly, after 21 years of negotiations,we adopted the legally bindingParis Agreement,all nations in the world keepingglobal warming under two degrees Celsius,aiming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.Today, three years down the line,we're still in the hand-waving business.
Now, I think it's timeto step back one stepand recognize that I wonder if the worldleaders really knew what they signedat the General Assembly three years ago.These are universal, aspirational,transformational goalsfor inclusive, prosperous humanityon a stable earth system.But there are underlying problems.We have inherent contradictionsbetween these goals,where there's the risk of pursuingone favored goal at the expense of others.Take, for example, Goal 8,on decent work and economic growth.If we continue doing thatby exploiting natural resourcesand burning fossil fuels,it will be impossible to reach Goal 13.Three years down the line,we simply must admitwe're seeing limited actionto really, really address thisas an inclusive, collective,universal package.
Now, this requires usto step back one step.I think we have to ask ourselvessome hard questions:Do we have any chance of accomplishingthe Sustainable Development Goals by 2030?Are there actually inherent trade-offsthat are not compatiblewith our current development paradigm?But are there, perhaps, synergieswhere we can really accelerate change?And is it really a people-planet agenda,really taking seriouslythe social and economic aspirational goalswithin the life-support systems on earth?
Now, citizens across the worldhave started to recognizethat we're facing globalrising environmental risks;in fact, that a stable planetis a prerequisiteto have good human well-being on earth.We need to define a safe operating spaceon a stable earth system,and the planetary boundaryframework was introducedby the scientific community in 2009to do exactly that.It has now been widely embracedacross the worldin policy, business and communitiesas a framework for sustainable developmentin the Anthropocene.
This slide really shows the frameworkwith the nine environmental processesthat regulate the stabilityof the earth system,providing a safe operating space,where we'll have a high chanceof having good human well-beingand prosperity and equity.If we move into the yellow zone,we enter a dangerous uncertainty zone;and into the red, we have a highlikelihood of crossing tipping pointsthat could take us irreversibly awayfrom the ability of the earth systemto provide social and economicwell-being for humanity.
Now, we can today, scientifically,quantify these boundaries,providing us a stableearth system for humanity.But we have to go beyond thisand recognize the SustainableDevelopment Goals —if we really wantto seriously accomplish them —must now occur withinthis safe operating space.We need to achieve SDGs within PBs.
But dear friends, not even this is enough.We need to recognizethat the Sustainable Development Goalsis 12 years away.It's only a milestone.It is the bull's-eyethat we need to go throughand zoom ourselves towards transformationswhere we can have a good futurefor all co-citizens on earth,nine billion plus,within a stable earth systemin 2050 and beyond.
This is a quest,and in order to really explore thisand not have only opinions about it,we gathered the scientific community,the best thinkers and modelersand started to develop a completelynew complex systems dynamic model,the Earth-3 model,building on models that have been aroundfor the last 50 years.And here it is.This is a fantastic piece of work.This has a climate module, a biospheremodule, a global economic model;it has algorithms, it has the whole roomof fantastic accomplishments.This is what turns us scientists on.
(Laughter)
I mean, this is justa beautiful piece of work?And I'd just love to spend the wholeevening walking this through with you,but I'll make you disappointed.I cannot do that.In fact, the only thing I can do with youis just to assure youthat this is the first time it's done.Nobody has ever triedto really analytically combinethe Sustainable Development Goalswith planetary boundaries.And we were able to find patternsand really convergent trendsthat gives us a lot of confidencein our ability to now projecteconomic development,resources use from water, food and energy,population growth, income per person,yet along these consistentand systemic pathways.So, it's the first time we havea robust opportunityto really explore the futures of abilityof attaining the SDGs within PBs.
Now, how do we do this?Well, look at this.Here, you have the datacoming from the real world,calibrated from 1970-2015:100,000 data points around the world,building on seven regions' ability,of really picking on all theseSustainable Development Goals.Now, one example of howwe calibrated this,here you have data] forSustainable Development Goalson eradicating poverty, health,education and food.And here you have in the bubblesthe seven regions of the world,how they move up until 2015in our empirical observationsin relation to GDP per capita,giving these universal convergent trends,which enabled us to create regressionsthat could make us able to dosimulations into the future,all the way until 2050,showing the ability alongthe lines here to attain the SDGs.
Now, this gave us the opportunityof doing several scenarios,testing different possible futures:business as usual, global transformations,investment schemes in business,different governance options,policies, finance —really, to explore whatthe future can look likein our ability to attainthe SDGs within PBs.And the results, I can tell you,really surprised us.And this will bethe first time it's shown.It should actually not evenbe referenced outside of this room.
Now, it actually is presentedalong two axes.The y-axis here shows our abilityto stay within planetary boundaries.The higher up, the closer you areto the safe operating space.On the x-axis arethe Sustainable Development Goals;the further to the right,the more of the SDGs we fulfill.We all want to be inthe upper right-hand corner,the safe and just world for the future.Now, the point you see there is 1980.We were in a situation where we actuallywere in a safe operating spacebut not meeting so many of the SDGs.Here's the trend up until 2015.So this is the conventional world,which is actually deliveringon an increasing number of SDGs,lifting millions of people out of poverty,but doing it at the expenseof the safe operating space on earth.
Now, this is the scenariobusiness as usual, into the future.If we just move on as today,we will be able to deliveron some of the SDGs,but we'll do it at the expenseof the stability of the earth system.Now, what if we go fasteron economic growthand really ally on one percentincrease per year of incomeand an even triplingof the world economy by 2050?That would give usthe following trajectory.We would, yes, go a little bit furtheron SDG accomplishments,but still at the expense of the riskof destabilizing the planet.But what if we really go harder?What if we increase our abilityto deliver on our promises by 30 percentacross all sectors in society,from climate to our trade agreements?A harder scenario would take usa little bit better,but still, we're failing on the SDGs,and we are not accomplishinga safe operating space for humanity.
So this really led us to a quitedisappointing conclusion,that we will actually, even if we goconventional futures, fail on the SDGsand transgress planetary boundaries.We need some radical thinking.We need to go intoa transformative, disruptive future,where we start thinkingoutside of the box.The modeling and engagementand dialogues enable us to identifyfive transformations that couldactually potentially take us there.
The first one is to cut emissionsby half every decadealong the scientific pathway to Paris,doubling investments in renewable energy,creating a global energy democracy,allowing us to meet several of the SDGs.
The second is a rapid shifttowards sustainable food systems,investing one percent per yearin sustainable intensificationand really moving towards implementingand investing in solutionsthat we already have available today.
The third is really to shiftour development paradigmand learn from manyof the developing countriesthat have moved very fast.What if we could havean economic growth such as in China,while doing it withinthe environmental parametersof an ecological civilization?
Fourth, a redistribution of wealth.What if we could agree]that the richest 10 percentcould not allow themselves to amassmore than 40 percent, maximum,of national incomes —a drastic redistribution of wealth,reforming the abilityof equity across regions?
And finally, fifth, a radical increasein more education, health,access to work, contraception,investing largely in womenacross the world,allowing us to deliver on SDGson gender, inequality,economics and urban development.
Now, if we would push ourselvesacross all these five —we tested this, and it would give usan amazing journeytowards the safe and justoperating space on earth.It shows us that even witha conservative, empirically based,complex system dynamics model,we are at a state where we canactually think of transformationsover the next 12 years and beyondthat can take us up intothe safe operating spaceand deliver on aspirationalsocial and economic goals.This is actually quite uplifting,despite the fact that we'renot moving along this trajectory.
So, in summary:we now, three years intothe operational delivery on the SDGs,must draw a lineand conclude that we're notdelivering on our promises,and not only that, we're running the risksof future generations havingan even tougher ability,because of the risk of pushingthe earth system beyond tipping points.In fact, we are facing evena risk of a hothouse earth,where we will undermineand create geopolitical instabilitiesthat could actually make lifeeven more toughfor billions of people on earth.This, in all honesty,really, really scares me.
But that's also whyI'm standing here tonight,because the windowof success is still open.The earth system is still resilient.She is still providing uswith ecosystem services and functionsthat can allow us a transitionback into a safe operating space.But we need radically different thinking.We need to see thisas an incredible wake-up callbut also an opportunityfor transformative change,where we shift gearsand really start thinkingof the SDGs as a transformative agendawithin a safe operating space on earth.In other words, we can builda safe and just world.We just have to really,really get on with it.And let's do it. Thank you.

There are 200 million clinical casesof falciparum malariain Africa every year,resulting in half a million deaths.I would like to talk to youabout malaria vaccines.The ones that we have made to dateare simply not good enough.Why?
We've been working at itfor 100 plus years.When we started, technology was limited.We could see just a tiny fractionof what the parasite really looked like.Today, we are awash with technology,advanced imaging and omics platforms —genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics.These tools have given us a clearer viewof just how complexthe parasite really is.
However, in spite of this,our approach to vaccine designhas remained pretty rudimentary.To make a good vaccine,we must go back to basicsto understand how our bodieshandle this complexity.
People who are frequentlyinfected with malarialearn to deal with it.They get the infection,but they don't get ill.The recipe is encoded in antibodies.My team went back to our complex parasite,probed it with samples from Africanswho had overcome malariato answer the question:"What does a successfulantibody response look like?"We found over 200 proteins,many of which are noton the radar for malaria vaccines.My research community may be missing outimportant parts of the parasite.
Until recently, when one had identifieda protein of interest,they tested whether it might beimportant for a vaccineby conducting a cohort study.This typically involved about 300participants in a village in Africa,whose samples were analyzed to seewhether antibodies to the proteinwould predict who got malariaand who did not.
In the past 30 years,these studies have testeda small number of proteinsin relatively few samplesand usually in single locations.The results have not been consistent.My team essentially collapsed30 years of this type of researchinto one exciting experiment,conducted over just three months.
Innovatively, we assembled 10,000 samplesfrom 15 locationsin seven African countries,spanning time, ageand the variable intensityof malaria experienced in Africa.We used omics intelligenceto prioritize our parasite proteins,synthesize them in the laband in short, recreatedthe malaria parasite on a chip.We did this in Africa,and we're very proud of that.
(Applause)
The chip is a small glass slide,but it gives us incredible power.We simultaneously gathered dataon over 100 antibody responses.What are we looking for?The recipe behind a successfulantibody response,so that we can predictwhat might make a good malaria vaccine.We're also trying to figure outexactly what antibodiesdo to the parasite.How do they kill it?Do they attack from multiple angles?Is there synergy?How much antibody do you need?
Our studies suggest that havinga bit of one antibody won't be enough.It might take highconcentrations of antibodiesagainst multiple parasite proteins.We're also learning that antibodieskill the parasite in multiple ways,and studying any one of these in isolationmay not adequately reflect reality.Just like we can now see the parasitein greater definition,my team and I are focusedon understanding how our bodiesovercome this complexity.We believe that this could providethe breakthroughs that we needto make malaria historythrough vaccination.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Cheers)
(Applause)
Shoham Arad: OK, how closeare we actually to a malaria vaccine?
Faith Osier: We're justat the beginning of a processto try and understandwhat we need to put in the vaccinebefore we actually start making it.So, we're not really close to the vaccine,but we're getting there.
SA: And we're hopeful.
FO: And we're very hopeful.
SA: Tell me about SMART,tell me what does it stand forand why is it important to you?
FO: So SMART stands for South-SouthMalaria Antigen Research Partnership.The South-Southis referring to us in Africa,looking sideways to each otherin collaboration,in contrast to always looking to Americaand looking to Europe,when there is quitesome strength within Africa.So in SMART,apart from the goal that we have,to develop a malaria vaccine,we are also training African scientists,because the burdenof disease in Africa is high,and you need people who will continueto push the boundariesin science, in Africa.
SA: Yes, yes, correct.
(Applause)
OK, one last question.Tell me, I know youmentioned this a little bit,but how would things actually changeif there were a malaria vaccine?
FO: We would savehalf a million lives every year.Two hundred million cases.It's estimated that malaria costs Africa12 billion US dollars a year.So this is economics.Africa would simply thrive.
SA: OK. Thank you, Faith.Thank you so much.

There was a day, about 10 years ago,when I asked a friend to holda baby dinosaur robot upside down.It was this toy called a Pleothat I had ordered,and I was really excited about itbecause I've always loved robots.And this one has really cooltechnical features.It had motors and touch sensorsand it had an infrared camera.And one of the things it hadwas a tilt sensor,so it knew what direction it was facing.And when you held it upside down,it would start to cry.And I thought this was super cool,so I was showing it off to my friend,and I said, "Oh, hold it up by the tail.See what it does."So we're watchingthe theatrics of this robotstruggle and cry out.And after a few seconds,it starts to bother me a little,and I said, "OK, that's enough now.Let's put him back down."And then I pet the robotto make it stop crying.
And that was kind ofa weird experience for me.For one thing, I wasn't the mostmaternal person at the time.Although since then I've becomea mother, nine months ago,and I've learned that babies also squirmwhen you hold them upside down.
(Laughter)
But my response to this robotwas also interestingbecause I knew exactlyhow this machine worked,and yet I still feltcompelled to be kind to it.And that observation sparked a curiositythat I've spent the past decade pursuing.Why did I comfort this robot?And one of the things I discoveredwas that my treatment of this machinewas more than just an awkward momentin my living room,that in a world where we're increasinglyintegrating robots into our lives,an instinct like thatmight actually have consequences,because the first thing that I discoveredis that it's not just me.
In 2007, the Washington Postreported that the United States militarywas testing this robotthat defused land mines.And the way it workedwas it was shaped like a stick insectand it would walkaround a minefield on its legs,and every time it stepped on a mine,one of the legs would blow up,and it would continue on the other legsto blow up more mines.And the colonel who was in chargeof this testing exerciseends up calling it off,because, he says, it's too inhumaneto watch this damaged robotdrag itself along the minefield.Now, what would causea hardened military officerand someone like myselfto have this response to robots?
Well, of course, we're primedby science fiction and pop cultureto really want to personify these things,but it goes a little bit deeper than that.It turns out that we're biologicallyhardwired to project intent and lifeonto any movement in our physical spacethat seems autonomous to us.So people will treat all sortsof robots like they're alive.These bomb-disposal units get names.They get medals of honor.They've had funerals for themwith gun salutes.And research shows that we do thiseven with very simple household robots,like the Roomba vacuum cleaner.
(Laughter)
It's just a disc that roamsaround your floor to clean it,but just the fact it's movingaround on its ownwill cause people to name the Roombaand feel bad for the Roombawhen it gets stuck under the couch.
(Laughter)
And we can design robotsspecifically to evoke this response,using eyes and faces or movementsthat people automatically,subconsciously associatewith states of mind.And there's an entire body of researchcalled human-robot interactionthat really shows how well this works.So for example, researchersat Stanford University found outthat it makes people really uncomfortablewhen you ask them to toucha robot's private parts.
(Laughter)
So from this, but from many other studies,we know, we know that peoplerespond to the cues given to themby these lifelike machines,even if they know that they're not real.
Now, we're headed towards a worldwhere robots are everywhere.Robotic technology is moving outfrom behind factory walls.It's entering workplaces, households.And as these machines that can senseand make autonomous decisions and learnenter into these shared spaces,I think that maybe the bestanalogy we have for thisis our relationship with animals.Thousands of years ago,we started to domesticate animals,and we trained them for workand weaponry and companionship.And throughout history, we've treatedsome animals like tools or like products,and other animals,we've treated with kindnessand we've given a place in societyas our companions.I think it's plausible we might startto integrate robots in similar ways.
And sure, animals are alive.Robots are not.And I can tell you,from working with roboticists,that we're pretty far away from developingrobots that can feel anything.But we feel for them,and that matters,because if we're trying to integraterobots into these shared spaces,we need to understand that people willtreat them differently than other devices,and that in some cases,for example, the case of a soldierwho becomes emotionally attachedto the robot that they work with,that can be anythingfrom inefficient to dangerous.But in other cases,it can actually be usefulto foster this emotionalconnection to robots.We're already seeing some great use cases,for example, robots workingwith autistic childrento engage them in waysthat we haven't seen previously,or robots working with teachers to engagekids in learning with new results.And it's not just for kids.Early studies show that robotscan help doctors and patientsin health care settings.
This is the PARO baby seal robot.It's used in nursing homesand with dementia patients.It's been around for a while.And I remember, years ago,being at a partyand telling someone about this robot,and her response was,"Oh my gosh.That's horrible.I can't believe we're giving peoplerobots instead of human care."And this is a really common response,and I think it's absolutely correct,because that would be terrible.But in this case,it's not what this robot replaces.What this robot replaces is animal therapyin contexts wherewe can't use real animalsbut we can use robots,because people will consistently treatthem more like an animal than a device.
Acknowledging this emotionalconnection to robotscan also help us anticipate challengesas these devices move into more intimateareas of people's lives.For example, is it OKif your child's teddy bear robotrecords private conversations?Is it OK if your sex robothas compelling in-app purchases?
(Laughter)
Because robots plus capitalismequals questions aroundconsumer protection and privacy.
And those aren't the only reasonsthat our behavior aroundthese machines could matter.A few years after that firstinitial experience I hadwith this baby dinosaur robot,I did a workshopwith my friend Hannes Gassert.And we took fiveof these baby dinosaur robotsand we gave them to five teams of people.And we had them name themand play with them and interact with themfor about an hour.And then we unveileda hammer and a hatchetand we told them to tortureand kill the robots.
(Laughter)
And this turned out to bea little more dramaticthan we expected it to be,because none of the participantswould even so much as strikethese baby dinosaur robots,so we had to improvise a little,and at some point, we said,"OK, you can save your team's robotif you destroy another team's robot."
(Laughter)
And even that didn't work.They couldn't do it.So finally, we said,"We're going to destroy all of the robotsunless someone takesa hatchet to one of them."And this guy stood up,and he took the hatchet,and the whole room wincedas he brought the hatchet downon the robot's neck,and there was this half-joking,half-serious moment of silence in the roomfor this fallen robot.
(Laughter)
So that was a reallyinteresting experience.Now, it wasn't a controlledstudy, obviously,but it did lead to somelater research that I did at MITwith Palash Nandy and Cynthia Breazeal,where we had people come into the laband smash these HEXBUGsthat move around in a reallylifelike way, like insects.So instead of choosing something cutethat people are drawn to,we chose something more basic,and what we foundwas that high-empathy peoplewould hesitate more to hit the HEXBUGS.
Now this is just a little study,but it's part of a larger body of researchthat is starting to indicatethat there may be a connectionbetween people's tendencies for empathyand their behavior around robots.But my question for the coming eraof human-robot interactionis not: "Do we empathize with robots?"It's: "Can robots changepeople's empathy?"Is there reason to, for example,prevent your childfrom kicking a robotic dog,not just out of respect for property,but because the child might bemore likely to kick a real dog?
And again, it's not just kids.This is the violent video games question,but it's on a completely new levelbecause of this visceral physicalitythat we respond more intensely tothan to images on a screen.When we behave violently towards robots,specifically robotsthat are designed to mimic life,is that a healthy outletfor violent behavioror is that training our cruelty muscles?We don't know ...But the answer to this question hasthe potential to impact human behavior,it has the potentialto impact social norms,it has the potential to inspire rulesaround what we can and can't dowith certain robots,similar to our animal cruelty laws.Because even if robots can't feel,our behavior towards themmight matter for us.And regardless of whetherwe end up changing our rules,robots might be able to help uscome to a new understanding of ourselves.
Most of what I've learnedover the past 10 yearshas not been about technology at all.It's been about human psychologyand empathy and how we relate to others.Because when a child is kind to a Roomba,when a soldier tries to savea robot on the battlefield,or when a group of people refusesto harm a robotic baby dinosaur,those robots aren't just motorsand gears and algorithms.They're reflections of our own humanity.
Thank you.

How many of us have ever seen something,thought that we should report it,but decided not to?And not that I needto see a show of hands,but I'm sure this has happenedto someone in this room before.In fact, when this questionwas asked to a group of employees,46 percent of them respondedby saying that they had seen somethingand decided not to report it.So if you raised your hand,or quietly raised your hand,don't feel bad, you're not alone.
This message of if you see somethingto say somethingis really all around us.Even when driving down the highway,you see billboards like this,encouraging us to report crimewithout revealing ourselves.But I still feel like a lot of usare really uncomfortablecoming forward in the name of the truth.
I'm an accounting professor,and I do fraud research.And in my class, I encourage my studentsto come forward with informationif they see it.Or in other words, encouragingmy students to become whistle-blowers.But if I'm being completelyhonest with myself,I am really conflicted with this messagethat I'm sending to my students.And here's why.Whistle-blowers are under attack.Headline after headline shows us this.Many people choosenot to become whistle-blowersdue to the fear of retaliation.From demotions to death threats,to job loss —perpetual job loss.Choosing to become a whistle-bloweris an uphill battle.Their loyalty becomes into question.Their motives, their trustworthiness.So how can I, as a professorwho really cares about her studentsencourage them to become whistle-blowers,when I know how the worldtruly feels about them?
So, one day I was getting readyfor my annual whistle-blower lecturewith my students.And I was workingon an article for "Forbes,"entitled "Wells Fargoand Millennial Whistle-blowing.What Do We Tell Them?"And as I was working on this pieceand reading about the case,I became outraged.And what made me angrywas when I came to the fact and realizedthat the employeesthat tried to whistle-blowwere actually fired.And it really made me thinkabout the messagethat I was sharing with my students.And it made me think: What if my studentshad been Wells Fargo employees?On the one hand, if they whistle-blew,they would have gotten fired.But on the other hand,if they didn't reportthe frauds that they knew,the way current regulation is written,employees are held responsibleif they knew somethingand didn't report it.So criminal prosecution is a real option.What's a person supposed to dowith those type of odds?
I of all people knowthe valuable contributionsthat whistle-blowers make.In fact, most fraudsare discovered by them.Forty two percent of fraudsare discovered by a whistle-blowerin comparison to other methods,like measurement reviewand external audit.And when you thinkabout some of the more classicor historical fraud cases,it always is around a whistle-blower.Think Watergate —discovered by a whistle-blower.Think Enron — discoveredby a whistle-blower.And who can forget about Bernard Madoff,discovered by a whistle-blower?It takes a tremendous amount of courageto come forward in the name of the truth.But when we thinkabout the term whistle-blower,we often think of somevery descriptive words:rat,snake,traitor,tattletale, weasel.And those are the nice words,the ones I can say from the stage.
And so when I'm not in class,I go around the countryand I interview white-collar felons,whistle-blowers and victims of fraud.Because really I'm trying to understandwhat makes them tickand to bring those experiencesback into the classroom.But it's my interviews withwhistle-blowers that really stick with me.And they stick with me,because they make me questionmy own courage.When given the opportunity,would I actually speak up?And so, this is a couple storiesthat I want to share with you.
This is Mary.Mary Willingham is the whistle-blowerfrom the University of North Carolinaat Chapel Hill, academic fraud case.And Mary was a learning specialistat the university,and she worked with students,primarily student athletes.And what she noticed,when she was working with students,is they were turning in term papersthat seemed well beyondtheir reading levels.She started to ask a couple of questionsand she found outthat there was a databasewhere the student athletescould retrieve papers and turn them in.And then she found outthat some of her colleagueswere funneling students into fake classes,just to keep them eligible to play.Now, when Mary found this out,she was outraged.And so what she tried to dowas go to her direct supervisor.But they didn't do anything.And then Mary tried to go to someinternal university administrators.And they didn't do anything.
So, what happens when nobody listens?You blog.So Mary decided to develop a blog.Her blog went viral within 24 hours,and she was contacted by a reporter.Now, when she was contactedby this reporter,her identity was known.She was exposed.And when she was exposed,she received a demotion,death threats, over collegiate sports.Mary didn't do anything wrong.She didn't participate in the fraud.She really thoughtthat she was giving voiceto students that were voiceless.But her loyalty was questioned.Her trustworthiness and her motives.
Now, whistle-blowingdoesn't always have to endin demotions or death threats.Actually, in 2002, this wasthe cover of "Time" magazine,where we were actually honoringthree brave whistle-blowersfor their decision to come forwardin the name of the truth.And when you look at the research,22 percent of whistle-blowersactually report retaliation.So there is a huge population of peoplethat report and are not retaliated againstand that gives me hope.
So this is Kathe.Kathe Swanson is a retired city clerkfrom the city of Dixon.And one day, Kathe was doing her job,just like she always did,and she stumbled upona pretty interesting case.See, Kathe was at the end of the month,and she was doingher treasures report for the city,and typically, her boss, Rita Crundwell,gave her a list of accounts and said,"Kathe, call the bankand get these specific accounts."And Kathe did her job.But this particular day,Rita was out of town, and Kathe was busy.She picks up the phone, she calls the bankand says, "Fax me all of the accounts."And when she gets the fax,she sees that there is an accountthat has some withdrawalsand deposits in itthat she did not know about.It was an account controlled only by Rita.
So Kathe looked at the information,she reported it to her direct supervisor,which was then-mayor Burke,and this led into a huge investigation,a six-month investigation.Come to find out, Kathe's boss,Rita Crundwell, was embezzling money.Rita was embezzling 53 million dollarsover a 20-year period,and Kathe just happenedto stumble upon it.Kathe is a hero.And actually, I had the opportunityof interviewing Kathe for my documentary,"All the Queen's Horses."And Kathe wasn't seeking fame.In fact, she really didn't wantto talk to me for a really long time,but through strategic stalking,she ended up doing the interview.
(Laughter)
But she was seeking fairness, not fame.And if it wasn't for Kathe,who's to say this fraudwould have ever been discovered?
So, remember that "Forbes" articleI was talking about,that I was working on before my lecture?Well, I posted it and somethingreally fantastic happened.I started receiving emailsfrom whistle-blowers all over the world.And as I was receiving these emailsand responding back to them,there was a common themein the message that I received,and this is what it was:they all said this, "I blew the whistle,people really hate me now.I got fired, but guess what?I would do it all over again if I could."And so as I kept reading this message,all these messages,I wanted to think,what could I share with my students?And so, I pulled it all togetherand this is what I learned.
It's important for us to cultivate hope.Whistle-blowers are hopeful.Despite popular belief,they're not all disgruntled employeesthat have a beef with the company.Their hopefulness really iswhat drives them to come forward.We also have to cultivate commitment.Whistle-blowers are committed.And it's that passionto their organizationthat makes them want to come forward.Whistle-blowers are humble.Again, they're not seeking fame,but they are seeking fairness.And we need to continueto cultivate bravery.Whistle-blowers are brave.Often, they underestimatedthe impact whistle-blowinghad on their family,but what they continue to comment onis how hard it is to withhold the truth.
With that, I want to leave youwith one additional name:Peter Buxtun.Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-oldemployee for the US Public Health Service.And he was hired to interview peoplethat had sexually transmitted diseases.And through the course of his work,he noticed a clinical studythat was going on within the organization.And it was a study that was lookingat the progression of untreated syphilis.And so, there were600 African American malesthat were in this study.They were enticed into the studythrough being givenfree medical exams, burial insurance.And so, what happenedthrough the course of this study,is penicillin was discoveredto help treat syphilis.And what Peter noticed was,the participants in this studywere not given the penicillinto treat their syphilis.And the participants didn't know.
So similar to Mary, Peter tried to reportand talk to his internal supervisors,but no one listened.And so Peter thoughtthis was completely unfairand he tried to report again,and finally talked to a reporter —very similar to Mary.And in 1972, this was the front pageof the "New York Times":"Syphilis Victims in US StudyWent Untreated for 40 Years."This is known to us todayas the Tuskegee syphilis experiment.And Peter was the whistle-blower.What happened to the 600 men,you may wonder, the 600 original men?Twenty eight men died from syphilis.One hundred diedfrom syphilis complications,forty wives were infectedand 10 children were bornwith congenital syphilis.Who's to say what these numbers would beif it wasn't for the brave,courageous act of Peter?
We're all connected to Peter, actually.If you know anybodythat's in a clinical trial,the reason why we haveinformed consent todayis because of Peter's courageous act.
So let me ask you a question.That original question,a variation of the original question.How many of us have ever used the termsnitch, rattattletale,snake,weasel,leak?Anybody?
Before you get the urge to do that again,I want you to think a little bit.It might be the Mary,the Peter, the Kathes of the world.You might be the personthat could shape history,or they could be the personthat shapes yours.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It was my third day on the jobat a hot Silicon Valley start-upin early 2013.I was twice the ageof the dozen engineers in the room.I'd been brought in to the companybecause I was a seasonedexpert in my field,but in this particular room,I felt like a newbie amongstthe tech geniuses.I was listening to them talkand thinking that the best thingI could do was be invisible.And then suddenly, the 25-year-oldwizard leading the meeting stared at meand asked, "If you shipped a featureand no one used it,did it really ship?"
(Laughter)
"Ship a feature"?In that moment, Chip knewhe was in deep ship.
(Laughter)
I had no idea what he was talking about.I just sat there awkwardly,and mercifully, he moved onto someone else.I slid down in my chair,and I couldn't waitfor that meeting to end.
That was my introduction to Airbnb.I was asked and invitedby the three millennial cofoundersto join their companyto help them taketheir fast-growing tech start-upand turn it into a globalhospitality brand,as well as to be the in-housementor for CEO Brian Chesky.Now, I'd spent from age 26 to 52being a boutique hotel entrepreneur,and so I guess I'd learneda few things along the wayand accumulatedsome hospitality knowledge.But after my first week,I realized that the brave newhome-sharing worlddidn't need much of my old-schoolbricks-and-mortar hotel insights.A stark reality rocked me:What do I have to offer?I'd never been in a tech company before.Five and a half years ago, I had neverheard of the "sharing economy,"nor did I have an Uberor Lyft app on my phone.This was not my natural habitat.
So, I decided at that momentthat I could either run for the hills,or cast judgment on these young geniuses,or instead, turn the judgmentinto curiosityand actually see if I could matchmy wise eyes with their fresh eyes.I fancied myself a modern Margaret Meadamongst the millennials,and I quickly learned that I hadas much to offer themas they did to me.
The more I've seen and learnedabout our respective generations,the more I realize that we oftendon't trust each other enoughto actually share our respective wisdom.We may share a border,but we don't necessarily trusteach other enoughto share that respective wisdom.I believe, looking atthe modern workplace,that the trade agreement of our timeis opening up these intergenerationalpipelines of wisdomso that we can all learn from each other.
Almost 40 percent of usin the United Stateshave a boss that's younger than us,and that number is growing quickly.Power is cascading to the younglike never beforebecause of our increasing reliance on DQ:digital intelligence.We're seeing young foundersof companies in their early 20sscale them up to global giantsby the time they get to 30,and yet, we expectthese young digital leadersto somehow miraculously embodythe relationship wisdomswe older workershave had decades to learn.
It's hard to microwaveyour emotional intelligence.There's ample evidence that gender-and ethnically diverse companiesare more effective.But what about age?This is a very important question,because for the first time ever,we have five generations in the workplaceat the same time, unintentionally.Maybe it's time we gota little more intentionalabout how we work collectively.There have been a numberof European studiesthat have shown that age-diverse teamsare more effective and successful.So why is that only eight percentof the companiesthat have a diversityand inclusion programhave actually expanded that strategyto include age as just as importantof a demographic as gender or race?Maybe they didn't get the memo:the world is getting older!
One of the paradoxes of our timeis that baby boomers are more vibrantand healthy longer into life,we're actually working later into life,and yet we're feelingless and less relevant.Some of us feel like a cartonof milk — an old carton of milk —with an expiration date stampedon our wrinkled foreheads.For many of us in midlife,this isn't just a feeling,it is a harsh reality, when we suddenlylose our job and the phone stops ringing.For many of us, justifiably, we worrythat people see our experienceas a liability, not an asset.You've heard of the old phrase —or maybe the relatively new phrase —"Sixty is the new forty, physically."Right?When it comes to powerin the workplace today,30 is the new 50.All right, well, this is allpretty exciting, right?
(Laughter)
Truthfully, power is moving10 years younger.We're all going to live 10 years longer.Do the math.Society has created a new20-year irrelevancy gap.Midlife used to be 45 to 65,but I would suggest it now stretchesinto a midlife marathon 40 years long,from 35 to 75.But wait — there is a bright spot.Why is it that we actually get smarterand wiser about our humanity as we age?Our physical peak may be our 20s,our financial and salary peakmay be age 50,but our emotional peakis in midlife and beyond,because we have developed patternrecognition about ourselves and others.
So how can we get companiesto tap into that wisdomof the midlife folks,just as they nurture their digitalyoung geniuses as well?The most successful companiestoday and in the futurewill actually learn how to createa powerful alchemy of the two.
Here's how the alchemyworked for me at Airbnb:I was assigned a young, smart partner,who helped me developa hospitality department.Early on, Laura Hughes could seethat I was a little lost in this habitat,so she often satright next to me in meetingsso she could be my tech translator,and I could write her notes and shecould tell me, "That's what that means."Laura was 27 years old,she'd worked for Google for four yearsand then for a year and a halfat Airbnb when I met her.Like many of her millennial cohorts,she had actually grown intoa managerial rolebefore she'd gotten any formalleadership training.I don't care if you'rein the B-to-B world,the B-to-C world, the C-to-C worldor the A-to-Z world,business is fundamentally H-to-H:human to human.And yet, Laura's approach to leadershipwas really formedin the technocratic world,and it was purely metric driven.One of the things she said to mein the first few months was,"I love the fact that yourapproach to leadershipis to create a compelling visionthat becomes a North Star for us."
Now, my fact knowledge,as in, how many rooms a maid cleansin an eight-hour shift,might not be all that importantin a home-sharing world.My process knowledgeof "How do you get things done?"based upon understanding the underlyingmotivations of everybody in the room,was incredibly valuable,in a company where most people didn't havea lot of organizational experience.As I spent more time at Airbnb,I realized it's possiblea new kind of elder was emergingin the workplace.Not the elder of the past, who actuallywas regarded with reverence.No, what is striking about the modernelder is their relevance,their ability to use timeless wisdomand apply it to modern-day problems.
Maybe it's time we actually valued wisdomas much as we do disruption.And maybe it's time —not just maybe, it is time —for us to definitely reclaimthe word "elder"and give it a modern twist.The modern elder is as much an internas they are a mentor,because they realize, in a worldthat is changing so quickly,their beginners' mind and their catalyticcuriosity is a life-affirming elixir,not just for themselvesbut for everyone around them.Intergenerational improv has been knownin music and the arts:think Tony Bennett and Lady Gagaor Wynton Marsalisand the Young Stars of Jazz.This kind of riffing in the business worldis often called "mutual mentorship":millennial DQ for Gen X and boomer EQ.
I got to experience that kind ofintergenerational reciprocity with Lauraand our stellar data science teamwhen we were actuallyremaking and evolvingthe Airbnb peer-to-peer review system,using Laura's analytical mindand my human-centered intuition.With that perfect alchemyof algorithm and people wisdom,we were able to createand instantaneous feedback loopthat helped our hosts better understandthe needs of our guests.High tech meets high touch.At Airbnb, I also learnedas a modern elderthat my role was to intern publiclyand mentor privately.Search engines are brilliantat giving you an answer,but a wise, sage guide can offer youjust the right question.Google does not understand,at least not yet,nuance like a finely attunedhuman heart and mind.Over time,to my surprise,dozens and dozens of young employeesat Airbnb sought me outfor private mentoring sessions.But in reality, we were oftenjust mentoring each other.
In sum, CEO Brian Chesky brought me infor my industry knowledge,but what I really offeredwas my well-earned wisdom.Maybe it's time we retire the term"knowledge worker"and replaced it with "wisdom worker."We have five generationsin the workplace today,and we can operate likeseparate isolationist countries,or we can actually start to find a wayto bridge these generational borders.And it's time for us to actually lookat how to change up the physics of wisdomso it actually flows in both directions,from old to young and from young to old.
How can you apply this in your own life?Personally, who can you reach out toto create a mutualmentorship relationship?And organizationally,how can you create the conditionsto foster an intergenerationalflow of wisdom?This is the new sharing economy.
Thank you.

Today, we are a country divided,or at least that's what we're told.We are torn apartby immigration, education, gunsand health care.Health care is ugly and it is loud,so loud that it threatensto drown out everything else.
(Voice-over) Protesters: Health careis a human right! Fight, fight, fight!
Protesters: Hey hey! Ho ho!Obamacare has got to go!
Rebecca Onie: But what ifunderneath all the noise,we're not divided?What if the things that we don't ask aboutare the things that we most agree upon?It turns out that when we askthe right questions,the answers are startling,because we agree, not on health care,but on something more important:we agree on health.
For 20 years, I've been obsessedwith one question:What do we, what do all of us needin order to be healthy?As a college student in 1995,I spent months talking to physiciansat a chaotic hospital in Boston,asking them, "What's the one thingyour patients most need to be healthy?"They shared the same storyagain and again,one that I've heard hundredsof variations of since.They say, "Every day I see a patientwith an asthma exacerbation,and I prescribe a controller medication.But I know she is livingin a mold-infested apartment.Or I see a kid with an ear infection,and I prescribe antibiotics,but I know there is no food at home.And I don't ask about those issues,because there's nothing I can do."
Now, it seemed that it shouldn'tbe so complicatedto design a doctor's visit aroundwhat people actually need to be healthy.So I created Health Leads,an organization enabling thousandsof physicians and other caregiversto ask their patients,"What do you need to be healthy?"and then prescribe those things —fruits and vegetables, heat in the winter,electricity to refrigeratetheir medication —and we then navigatedpatients to those resourcesin their communities.
The model works.A Mass General Hospital study found thatnavigating patients to essential resourcesis associated with improvementsin blood pressure and cholesterol levelssimilar to introducing a new drug,but without all the side effects.
So two decades later, what's changed?It's now widely recognizedthat just 20 percent of health outcomesare tied to medical care,whereas up to 70 percentare tied to healthy behaviorsand what's called the socialdeterminants of health —basically, everything that happens to usfor that vast majority of timewhen we're not in the doctor's officeor the hospital.Health care executivesnow routinely remind usthat our zip code matters morethan our genetic code.And one health care publicationeven recently had the audacityto describe the socialdeterminants of healthas "the feel-good buzzword of the year."
Now, there's been some action, too.Over the past decade, six majorhealth care providers and insurershave committed over 600 million dollarsto affordable housing,recognizing that it reducesinfant mortalityand increases life expectancy.But let's be honest.Is our 3.5 trillion dollarhealth care systemfundamentally designed to create health?Absolutely not.
Take access to healthy food.Not long ago, a teenage boy shows upat a hospital in Baltimore,losing weight.Just as his doctors are huddled upfiguring out which metabolic panelsand blood tests to run,one of my colleagues asks out loud,"Do you think he might be hungry?"It turned out that this kidhad been kicked out of his housingand literally hadn't had a meal in weeks.He said he was "... so relievedthat somebody finally asked me."
Somehow, we've createda health care systemwhere asking a patient "Are you hungry?"is so far outside the boundsof what counts as health carethat we mostly fail or forgetto ask altogether;where doctors lament a hospital's"no third sandwich policy,"meaning that if you'rea hungry patient in the ER,you can have only two free sandwiches,but as many MRIs as the doctor orders;where, in 2016 in the state of Texas,they spent 1.2 billion dollarson the medical costs of malnutritioninstead of on access to healthy food;where a Centers for Medicareand Medicaid Services programstratifies hungry patients,so that some get access to foodand some get information about food,with the justification thatdoing nothing for hungry patientsis standard and usual carein this country.And that's just food.The same is truefor housing, electricity ...The bottom line is,health care may be changing,but not by enoughand certainly not fast enough.We ask the wrong questionsof our doctors, of our patients,but also of our citizens.We ask about and argue about health care,but how do voters think about health?
No one could tell usthe answer to that question,so we launched a new initiativeand hired a polling firmto ask voters across the country:What do you need to be healthy?What was so striking about thiswas that no one has any cluewhat we are talking about in health care.Voters do not thinkthe social determinants of healthis a feel-good phrase.They actually hate it."What uneducated personcame up with that language?"one of the voters said.Or my favorite was the guy who said,"You're killing me."But when you strip awayall the ridiculousnessof our language in health care,we know exactly what creates health.
So take Charlotte, North Carolina.We had two focus groups,one of African American Democratic womenand one of white Republican women.And we asked them,"If you had a hundred dollars,how would you spend itto buy health in your community?Turns out, they agreenearly to the last percentage point.First, they agree that health careonly sort of impacts health.So they choose to spendthe majority of their dollarsoutside of hospitals and clinics.And second, they agreeon what creates health,spending 19 percent on affordable housingand about 25 percenton access to healthy food.
So I am sure you are thinking,"This has got to be a fluke."But it's not.White and Latino maleswing voters in Seattle,white and African AmericanDemocratic voters in Cleveland,white male Republicans in Dallas,low-income white Democratsin Hendersonville, North Carolina:their answers are strikingly similar,with all of them choosingto spend more moneyon healthy food and safe housingthan they would on hospitalsand health centers.
When you ask the right questions,it becomes pretty clear:we may be fracturedon health care in this country,but we are unified on health.
The thing that I've beenstruggling with is why.Why do we agree on health?We agree on healthbecause it is common sense.We all know that the thingswe need to get healthy —medicine and medical care —are not the things we need to be healthy,to not get sick in the first place.But we also agree becauseof common experience.In a study of 5,000 patients,24 percent of the patientswith commercial health insurance —meaning, they had a job —still ran out of food or struggledto find housing or transportationor other essential resources.Twenty-four percent.And we saw the same thingin our focus groups.Nearly every voter knewwhat it meant to struggle,either themselves or their familiesor their neighbors.
One of those white Republicanwomen in Charlotte was a waitressstruggling to stay awakewith an enormous Big Gulp soda.She just looked exhausted.And she was.She told us that she worked two jobsbut still could not afforda membership to the Y,but it was OK that she couldn't goto the gym, she said,because she also could not afford gasand walked 10 miles to and from workevery single day.
Listening to her, I feltthis familiar panic rise in me,the residue of my own childhood.When I was 10 years old,my father lay on the living room floorin the grips of oneof his many depressions.As I crouched next to him, he told methat he wanted to kill himself.My father lived,but he struggled to work.And my family survived,but we teetered,down one paycheck,relying on my mom's schoolteacher salary.Even as a little kid, I knewwe lived in the shadowof financial and emotional collapse.This is really hard to say,because it's taken me 25 yearsto be honest with myselfthat this is why I do this work:knowing that my fatherneeded health care to recover,but to be healthy, my familyneeded something else,we needed a decent income;and knowing, as so many do more than I,that panic when the basicsthreaten to slip away.
To the voters in our focus groups,the solutions were straightforward.As one of those white Republicanwomen in Charlotte said,"Instead of putting all this moneyinto health care,put it into affordable housing.You know, like, take itand distribute it differently."It turns out that when you havethe right languageand you ask the right questions,the answers become remarkably clearand unanimous.What we know is that,despite all the noise,the plan for health care in this countryis that there is no plan.But we have something more powerfulthan any politician's bill,any candidate's platform,any think tank's policy statement.We have our common senseand our common experience.
So I ask, if you area health care executive:Do you know how manyof your patients run out of foodor struggle to pay the rentat the end of the month?Is that data on your scorecard,shaping your business and your bonuses?If you are a politician:Will you continue to fighton the scorched earth of health care,or will you act on what your voters,what Democraticand Republican voters alike,already know,which is that good wages,healthy food and safe housingare health?And for the rest of us,for the citizens of this country:Will we demand accountabilityto what we know to be true,which is that our common sense,our common experience,makes us the expertsin what it takes to be healthy?
This moment, as it turns out,is not about changing minds.It is about something more powerful.It is about changing the questions we askand quieting the noiseto hear each other's answers.It is about the radical possibilitythat we the patients,we the physicians, we the caregivers,we the health care executivesand yes, even we the people,that we agree.And it is now time —in fact, long overdue —for us to marshal the courageto hear those answersand to act upon them.
Thank you.

The good news is that your experimental robo-antsare a success!The bad news is that you accidentallyjust gave them the ability to shoot deadly lasers…and you can’t turn it off.You have five minutes to stop thembefore the lasers go online.
Until then,all of your robo-ants will walkinside their habitat at a speed ofexactly 1 meter per minute.If they bump into each other or hit a dead end,they’ll instantly turn aroundand walk back the way they came.When five minutes are up,they’ll turn on their lasers,break free,and stream out into the world,carving a path of destruction as they go.
Your one chance to stop them is to insertthe two emergency vacuum nozzles into the habitatand suck the ants up before they break free.The nozzles can press into any one locationin the habitat through a membrane coveringits front side, and any ants that walk pastwill be sucked up and deactivated.You can’t move the nozzles once they’re placedwithout leaving a hole that the robo-antswould pour out of, so choosing theright spots will be key.
The habitat is made out of meter-long tubes.When the robots reach an intersection,they will pick randomly whether to goleft, right, or forward.They only go backward if they hithit another robo-ant or a dead end.
Unfortunately, there are hundreds of theminside the habitat, and if even one escapes,it’ll do a lot of damage.
With just less than five minutes remaining,where should you place the 2 vacuum nozzlesto suck up all the robo-ants?Pause the video now ifyou want to figure it out for yourself.Answer in: 3Answer in: 2Answer in: 1
With robo-ants ricocheting all over the habitat,it might seem impossible to stop thembefore they break free.But this situation is simpler than it seems.Here's why.
Imagine just two robo-ants crawlingtoward each other.When they collide, they immediatelyreverse directions.And what would that sequence of events looklike if they crawled past each other instead?It would look exactly the same beforeand after their collision, but withtheir positions swapped.This is true every time a pair of robo-ants meet.Because the identities of individual antsdon’t matter, you just need to figure out whereyou should put the nozzles to captureany single ant walking without interruptionfor less than 5 minutes, starting fromany point in the habitat.
That’s much easier to conceptualize and solve.Placing the nozzles at intersections wherethree or four tubes meet seems like your best betsince that’s where the robo-ants might otherwisechange directions and miss your nozzles.
There are only four intersections…which two should you pick?
The top right intersection has to be one of them.If it isn’t, an ant crawling down fromthis intersection toward the dead end wouldcrawl for four minutes to get back to theintersection, and then go in any of threedirections, walking for at least another minute.Once you’ve placed a nozzle in the top right,the only other choice that has a chanceto work is the bottom left.To see that this works, imagine an antanywhere else in the habitat.Worst case scenario, the ant would startright next to the vacuum nozzle, marching away from it.But in all those worst cases, the ant would marchfor at most 4 meters before being suckedup into the vacuum.No other choice of two intersection pointsis guaranteed to get all the robo-antswithin five minutes.
Having vacuumed them all up, you’veaverted a major crisis.Before you mess with robo-ants again,you’ll want to have a robo-anteater ready.And wouldn’t it be cool if it couldfly and breathe fire?There’s no way that could go wrong!
In 2013, I was an executiveat an international engineering firmin San Francisco.It was my dream job.A culmination of all the skillsthat I've acquired over the years:storytelling, social impact,behavior change.I was the head of marketing and cultureand I worked with the nation'slargest health care systems,using technology and culture changeto radically reducetheir energy and water useand to improve their social impact.I was creating real change in the world.And it was the worstprofessional experience of my life.
I hit the glass ceiling hard.It hurt like hell.While there were bigger issues,most of what happenedwere little behaviors and patternsthat slowly chipped awayat my ability to do my work well.They ate away at my confidence,my leadership, my capacity to innovate.For example, my firstpresentation at the company.I walk up to the front of the roomto give a presentation on the strategythat I believe is right for the company.The one they hired me to create.And I look around the roomat my fellow executives.And I watch as theypick up their cell phonesand look down at their laptops.They're not paying attention.As soon as I start to speak,the interruptions beginand people talk over meagain and again and again.Some of my ideas are flat out dismissedand then brought upby somebody else and championed.I was the only woman in that room.And I could have used an ally.
Little behaviors and pattern like this,every day, again and again,they wear you down.Pretty soon, my energywas absolutely tapped.At a real low point, I read an articleabout toxic workplace cultureand microaggressions.Microaggressions —everyday slights, insults,negative verbaland nonverbal communication,whether intentional or not,that impede your abilityto do your work well.That sounded familiar.I started to realizethat I wasn't failing.The culture around me was failing me.And I wasn't alone.
Behaviors and patterns like thisevery day affect underrepresented peopleof all backgrounds in the workplace.And that has a real impacton our colleagues, on our companiesand our collective capacity to innovate.So, in the tech industry,we want quick solutions.But there is no magic wandfor correcting diversity and inclusion.Change happens one person at a time,one act at a time, one word at a time.
We make a mistakewhen we see diversity and inclusionas that side project over therethe diversity people are working on,rather than this work inside all of usthat we need to do together.And that work beginswith unlearning what we knowabout success and opportunity.We've been told our whole livesthat if we work hard,that hard work pays off,we'd get what we deserve,we'd live our dream.But that isn't true for everyone.Some people have to work 10 times as hardto get to the same placedue to many barriersput in front of them by society.Your gender, your race, your ethnicity,your religion, your disability,your sexual orientation,your class, your geography,all of these can give you moreof fewer opportunities for success.
And that's where allyship comes in.Allyship is about understandingthat imbalance in opportunityand working to correct it.Allyship is really seeingthe person next to us.And the person missing,who should be standing next to us.And first, just knowingwhat they're going through.And then, helping them succeedand thrive with us.When we work together to developmore diverse and inclusive teams,data shows we will be more innovative,more productive and more profitable.
So, who is an ally?All of us.We can all be allies for each other.As a white, cisgendered womanin the United States,there are many ways I'm very privileged.And some ways I'm not.And I work hard every dayto be an ally for peoplewith less privilege than me.And I still need allies, too.
In the tech industry,like in many industries,there are many peoplewho are underrepresented,or face barriers and discrimination.Women, people who are nonbinary —so people who don't necessarilyidentify as man or woman —racial and ethnic minorities,LGBTQIA, peoplewith disabilities, veterans,anybody over age 35.
(Laughter)
We have a major bias toward youthin the tech industry.And many others.There is always someonewith less privilege than you.On this stage, in this room.At your company, on your team,in your city or town.So, people are alliesfor different reasons.Find your reason.It could be for the business case,because data showsdiverse and inclusive teamswill be more productive,more profitable and more innovative.It could be for fairnessand social justice.Because we have a long historyof oppression and inequitythat we need to work on together.Or it could be for your kids,so your kids grow upwith equal opportunities.And they grow up creatingequal opportunities for others.Find your reason.For me, it's all three.Find your reason and step upto be there for someone who needs you.
So, what can you do as an ally?Start by doing no harm.It's our job as allies to know whatmicroaggressions are and to not do them.It's our job as alliesto listen, to learn,to unlearn and to relearn,and to make mistakes and to keep learning.Give me your full attention.Close your laptops,put down your cellphonesand pay attention.If somebody is new or the onlyperson in the room like them,or they're just nervous,this is going to make a huge differencein how they show up.
Don't interrupt.Underrepresented peopleare more likely to be interrupted,so just take a step back and listen.Echo and attribute.If I have a great idea,echo my idea and then attribute it to me,and we thrive together.Learn the language I useto describe my identity.Know how to pronounce my name.Know my pronouns — he, she, they.Know the language I use to describemy disability, my ethnicity, my religion.This really matters to people,so if you don't know, just ask.Listen and learn.
An executive told me recentlythat after doing allyship on his team,the whole team started to normalizecalling themselves out and each other outfor interrupting."I'm so sorry I'm interruptingyou right now, carry on.""Hey, she's gota great idea, let's listen."
Number two, advocatefor underrepresented people in small ways.Intervene; you can changethe power dynamics in the room.If you see somebody is the onlyperson in the room like themand they are being belittled,they are being interrupted,do something, say something.Invite underrepresented people to speak.And say no to panelswithout underrepresented speakers.Refer someone for a joband encourage them to take that joband to take new opportunities.And this one's really important —help normalize allyship.If you're a person with privilege,it's easier for youto advocate for allies.So use that privilege to create change.
Three, change someone'slife significantly.So, be there for somebodythroughout their career.Mentor or sponsor them,give them opportunities as they grow.Volunteer — volunteer for a STEM program,serving underserved youth.Transform your teamto be more diverse and inclusive.And make real commitmentsto creating change here.Hold yourself and your teamaccountable for creating change.
And lastly,help advocate for changeacross your company.When companies teachtheir people to be allies,diversity and inclusionprograms are stronger.You and I can be allies for each other,whether we're inside or outside of work.
So, I realized recentlythat I still have lingering shame and fearfrom that moment in my careerwhen I felt utterly alone,shut out and unsupported.There are millions of people out there,like me, right now, feeling that way.And it doesn't take muchfor us to be there for each other.And when we're there for each other,when we support one another,we thrive together.And when we thrive, we build better teams,better products and better companies.Allyship is powerful.Try it.
Thank you.

Who do you want to be?It's a simple question,and whether you know it or not,you're answering it every daythrough your actions.This one question will defineyour professional successmore than any other,because how you show upand treat people means everything.Either you lift people upby respecting them,making them feel valued,appreciated and heard,or you hold people downby making them feel small,insulted, disregarded or excluded.And who you choose to be means everything.
I study the effectsof incivility on people.What is incivility?It's disrespect or rudeness.It includes a lot of different behaviors,from mocking or belittling someoneto teasing people in ways that stingto telling offensive jokesto texting in meetings.And what's uncivil to one personmay be absolutely fine to another.Take texting while someone'sspeaking to you.Some of us may find it rude,others may think it's absolutely civil.So it really depends.It's all in the eyes of the beholderand whether that person felt disrespected.We may not mean to makesomeone feel that way,but when we do, it has consequences.
Over 22 years ago,I vividly recall walking intothis stuffy hospital room.It was heartbreaking to see my dad,this strong, athletic, energetic guy,lying in the bed with electrodesstrapped to his bare chest.What put him therewas work-related stress.For over a decade,he suffered an uncivil boss.And for me, I thought he wasjust an outlier at that time.But just a couple years later,I witnessed and experienceda lot of incivilityin my first job out of college.I spent a year going to work every dayand hearing things from coworkers like,"Are you an idiot?That's not how it's done,"and, "If I wanted your opinion, I'd ask."
So I did the natural thing.I quit, and I went back to grad schoolto study the effects of this.There, I met Christine Pearson.And she had a theorythat small, uncivil actionscan lead to much bigger problemslike aggression and violence.We believed that incivility affectedperformance and the bottom line.So we launched a study,and what we found was eye-opening.
We sent a survey to business school alumniworking in all different organizations.We asked them to write a few sentencesabout one experiencewhere they were treated rudely,disrespectfully or insensitively,and to answer questionsabout how they reacted.One person told us about a bossthat made insulting statements like,"That's kindergartner's work,"and another tore up someone's workin front of the entire team.And what we found is that incivilitymade people less motivated:66 percent cut back work efforts,80 percent lost timeworrying about what happened,and 12 percent left their job.
And after we published these results,two things happened.One, we got calls from organizations.Cisco read about these numbers,took just a few of theseand estimated, conservatively,that incivility was costing them12 million dollars a year.
The second thing that happened was,we heard from others in our academic fieldwho said, "Well, people are reportingthis, but how can you really show it?Does people's performance really suffer?"I was curious about that, too.With Amir Erez, I comparedthose that experienced incivilityto those that didn'texperience incivility.And what we found is that thosethat experience incivilitydo actually function much worse.
"OK," you may say. "This makes sense.After all, it's naturalthat their performance suffers."But what about if you're notthe one who experiences it?What if you just see or hear it?You're a witness.We wondered if it affected witnesses, too.
So we conducted studieswhere five participants would witnessan experimenter act rudelyto someone who arrived late to the study.The experimenter said,"What is it with you?You arrive late, you're irresponsible.Look at you! How do you expectto hold a job in the real world?"And in another study in a small group,we tested the effects of a peerinsulting a group member.Now, what we found was really interesting,because witnesses'performance decreased, too —and not just marginally,quite significantly.
Incivility is a bug.It's contagious,and we become carriers of itjust by being around it.And this isn't confined to the workplace.We can catch this virus anywhere —at home, online, in schoolsand in our communities.It affects our emotions,our motivation, our performanceand how we treat others.It even affects our attentionand can take some of our brainpower.And this happens not onlyif we experience incivilityor we witness it.It can happen even if wejust see or read rude words.Let me give you an example of what I mean.
To test this, we gave peoplecombinations of wordsto use to make a sentence.But we were very sneaky.Half the participants got a listwith 15 words used to trigger rudeness:impolitely, interrupt, obnoxious, bother.Half the participantsreceived a list of wordswith none of these rude triggers.And what we found was really surprising,because the people who got the rude wordswere five times more likely to missinformation right in front of themon the computer screen.And as we continued this research,what we found is that thosethat read the rude wordstook longer to make decisions,to record their decisions,and they made significantly more errors.This can be a big deal,especially when it comesto life-and-death situations.
Steve, a physician, told meabout a doctor that he worked withwho was never very respectful,especially to junior staff and nurses.But Steve told me aboutthis one particular interactionwhere this doctor shoutedat a medical team.Right after the interaction,the team gave the wrong dosageof medication to their patient.Steve said the informationwas right there on the chart,but somehow everyoneon the team missed it.He said they lacked the attentionor awareness to take it into account.Simple mistake, right?Well, that patient died.
Researchers in Israel have actually shownthat medical teams exposed to rudenessperform worse not onlyin all their diagnostics,but in all the procedures they did.This was mainly becausethe teams exposed to rudenessdidn't share information as readily,and they stopped seekinghelp from their teammates.And I see this not only in medicinebut in all industries.
So if incivility has such a huge cost,why do we still see so much of it?I was curious, so we surveyedpeople about this, too.The number one reason is stress.People feel overwhelmed.The other reason that peopleare not more civilis because they're skepticaland even concernedabout being civil or appearing nice.They believe they'll appearless leader-like.They wonder: Do nice guys finish last?Or in other words: Do jerks get ahead?(Laughter)It's easy to think so,especially when we seea few prominent examplesthat dominate the conversation.
Well, it turns out,in the long run, they don't.There's really rich research on thisby Morgan McCall and Michael Lombardowhen they were atthe Center for Creative Leadership.They found that the number one reasontied to executive failurewas an insensitive, abrasiveor bullying style.There will always be some outliersthat succeed despite their incivility.Sooner or later, though,most uncivil peoplesabotage their success.For example, with uncivil executives,it comes back to hurt themwhen they're in a place of weaknessor they need something.People won't have their backs.
But what about nice guys?Does civility pay?Yes, it does.And being civil doesn't just meanthat you're not a jerk.Not holding someone downisn't the same as lifting them up.Being truly civil meansdoing the small things,like smiling and sayinghello in the hallway,listening fully whensomeone's speaking to you.Now, you can have strong opinions,disagree, have conflictor give negative feedback civilly,with respect.Some people call it "radical candor,"where you care personally,but you challenge directly.So yes, civility pays.In a biotechnology firm,colleagues and I foundthat those that were seen as civilwere twice as likelyto be viewed as leaders,and they performed significantly better.Why does civility pay?Because people see youas an important — and a powerful —unique combinationof two key characteristics:warm and competent, friendly and smart.In other words, being civilisn't just about motivating others.It's about you.If you're civil, you're more likelyto be seen as a leader.You'll perform better, and you're seenas warm and competent.
But there's an even bigger storyabout how civility pays,and it ties to one of the mostimportant questions around leadership:What do people want mostfrom their leaders?We took data from over20,000 employees around the world,and we found the answer was simple:respect.Being treated with respectwas more importantthan recognition and appreciation,useful feedback,even opportunities for learning.Those that felt respected were healthier,more focused,more likely to staywith their organizationand far more engaged.
So where do you start?How can you lift people upand make people feel respected?Well, the nice thing is,it doesn't require a huge shift.Small things can make a big difference.I found that thanking people,sharing credit,listening attentively,humbly asking questions,acknowledging others and smilinghas an impact.
Patrick Quinlan, former CEOof Ochsner Health System],told me about the effectsof their 10-5 way,where if you're within 10 feet of someone,you make eye contact and smile,and if you're within five feet,you say hello.He explained that civility spread,patient satisfaction scores rose,as did patient referrals.
Civility and respect can be usedto boost an organization's performance.When my friend Doug Conant took overas CEO of Campbell's Soup Company in 2001,the company's market sharehad just dropped in half.Sales were declining,lots of people had just been laid off.A Gallup manager said it wasthe least engaged organizationthat they had surveyed.And as Doug drove upto work his first day,he noticed that the headquarterswas surrounded by barbwire fence.There were guard towersin the parking lot.He said it looked likea minimum security prison.It felt toxic.
Within five years, Doughad turned things around.And within nine years, they were settingall-time performance recordsand racking up awards,including best place to work.How did he do it?On day one, Doug told employeesthat he was going to havehigh standards for performance,but they were goingto do it with civility.He walked the talk,and he expected his leaders to.For Doug, it all came downto being tough-minded on standardsand tenderhearted with people.For him, he said it was all aboutthese touch points,or these daily interactionshe had with employees,whether in the hallway,in the cafeteria or in meetings.And if he handled each touch point well,he'd make employees feel valued.
Another way that Dougmade employees feel valuedand showed them thathe was paying attentionis that he handwrote over 30,000thank-you notes to employees.And this set an example for other leaders.Leaders have about 400of these touch points a day.Most don't take long,less than two minutes each.The key is to be agile and mindfulin each of these moments.
Civility lifts people.We'll get people to give moreand function at their bestif we're civil.Incivility chips away at peopleand their performance.It robs people of their potential,even if they're just working around it.What I know from my research is thatwhen we have more civil environments,we're more productive, creative,helpful, happy and healthy.
We can do better.Each one of us can be more mindfuland can take actionsto lift others up around us,at work, at home, online,in schoolsand in our communities.In every interaction, think:Who do you want to be?
Let's put an end to incivility bugand start spreading civility.After all, it pays.
Thank you.

As of 2018, there are around 2.5 billion smartphone users in the world.If we broke open all their newest phones,which are just a fraction of the total that’ve been built,and split them into their component parts,that would produce around 85,000 kilograms of gold,875,000 of silver,and 40 million kilograms of copper.How did this precious cache get into our phones,and can we reclaim it?
Gold, silver, and copper are actually just a fewof the 70 or so chemical elements that make up the average smartphone.These can be divided into different groups,two of the most critical being rare earth elementsand precious metals.
Rare earths are a selection of 17 elementsthat are actually common in Earth’s crustand are found in many areas across the world in low concentrations.These elements have a hugerange of magnetic,phosphorescent,and conductive propertiesthat make them crucial to modern technologies.In fact, of the 17 types of rare earth metals,phones and other electronics may contain up to 16.In smartphones, these create the screen and color display,aid conductivity,and produce the signature vibrations,amongst other things.
And yet, crucial as they are,extracting these elements from the earthis linked to some disturbing environmental impacts.Rare earth elements can often be found,but in many areas,it’s not economically feasible to extract them due to low concentrations.Much of the time,extracting them requires a method called open pit miningthat exposes vast areas of land.This form of mining destroys huge swaths of natural habitats,and causes air and water pollution,threatening the health of nearby communities.
Another group of ingredients in smartphonescomes with similar environmental risks:these are metals such as copper,silver,palladium,aluminum,platinum,tungsten,tin,lead,and gold.We also mine magnesium,lithium,silica,and potassium to make phones,and all of it is associated with vast habitat destruction,as well as air and water pollution.Mining comes with worrying social problems, too,like large-scale human and animal displacementto make way for industrial operations,and frequently, poor working conditions for laborers.
Lastly, phone production also requires petroleum,one of the main drivers of climate change.That entwines our smartphones inextricablywith this growing planetary conundrum.
And, what’s more,the ingredients we mine to make our phones aren’t infinite.One day, they’ll simply run out,and we haven’t yet discovered effective replacements for some.Despite this,the number of smartphones is on a steady increase;by 2019 it’s predicted that there’ll be close to 3 billion in use.
This means that reclaiming the bounty within our phonesis swiftly becoming a necessity.So, if you have an old phone,you might want to consider your options before throwing it away.To minimize waste, you could donate it to a charity for reuse,take it to an e-waste recycling facility,or look for a company that refurbishes old models.
However, even recycling companies need our scrutiny.Just as the production of smartphonescomes with social and environmental problems,dismantling them does too.E-waste is sometimes intentionally exported to countrieswhere labor is cheap but working conditions are poor.Vast workforces, often made up of women and children,may be underpaid,lack the training to safely disassemble phones,and be exposed to elements like lead and mercury,which can permanently damage their nervous systems.Phone waste can also end up in huge dump sites,leaching toxic chemicals into the soil and water,mirroring the problems of the mines where the elements originated.
A phone is much more than it appears to be on the surface.It’s an assemblage of elementsfrom multiple countries,linked to impacts that are unfolding on a global scale.So, until someone invents a completely sustainable smartphone,we’ll need to come to termswith how this technologyaffects widespread places and people.
So I'm a professional poker player,and today, I want to talk aboutthree things that the game has taught mearound decision-makingthat I find apply to everyday life.
Now the first of these thingsis about luck.Now, like poker, life is alsoa game of skill and luck,and when it comesto the biggest things we care about —health, wealth and relationships —these outcomes don't only dependon the quality of our decision-making,but also the roll of life's dice.For example, we can beperfectly health-consciousand still get unluckywith something like cancer.Or we can smoke 20 a dayand live to a ripe old age,and this kind of ambiguitycan make it hard for us to knowhow good our strategies are, sometimes,especially when we'reexperiencing a lot of success.
For example, back in 2010,I won a really big poker tournamentknown as the European Poker Tour.And because I'd only been playingfull-time for about a year,when I won, I assumedI must be rather brilliant.In fact, I thought I was so brilliantthat I not only got rather lazywith studying the game,but I also got more risky,started playing inthe biggest tournaments I couldagainst the very best in the world.And then my profit graph wentfrom a thing of beautyto something kind of sad,with this worryingdownhill trend for a long time,until I finally realizedthat I was overestimating my skill level,and got my act together.
And this kind of reminds meof what we've been seeingin the cryptocurrency space,at least in 2017,where the only thing that's been going upfaster than the markets themselvesis the number of "seniorinvestment specialists"who have been appearing out of nowhere.Now I'm not saying it's not possibleto have a strategic edge,but at the same time,it's very easy to feel like a geniuswhen you're in a marketthat's going up so fastthat even the worst strategiesare making a profit.So when we're experiencing success,it's important to take a momentto really ask ourselveshow much of it is truly down to us,because our egos love to downplaythe luck factor when we're winning.
Now, a second thing poker taught meis the importanceof quantifying my thinking.When you're playing,you can't just get away with going,"Eh, they're probably bluffing."That's just going to lose youa bunch of money,because poker is a gameof probabilities and precision,and so you have to train yourselfto think in numbers.So now, whenever I catch myselfthinking vaguely about somethingreally important, like,"It's unlikely I'll forgetwhat I want to say in my TED Talk,"I now try to estimate it numerically.
(Laughter)
Trust me, it helps a lotwith the planning process.And the thing is, almost anythingthat could possibly happen here today,or at any point in the future,can also be expressedas a probability, too.
(Laughter)
So now I also try to speakin numbers as well.So if someone asks me,"Hey, Liv, do you think you're goingto come along to that thing tonight?"instead of just saying to them,"Yeah, probably,"I actually give them my best estimate —say, 60 percent.Because — I know that soundsa little odd —but the thing is, I ran a poll on Twitterof what people understandthe word "probably" to mean,and this was the spread of answers.Enormous!So apparently, it's absolutely uselessat actually conveyingany real information.
So if you guys catch yourselvesusing these vague words,like "probably" or "sometimes,"try, instead, using numbers,because when we speak in numbers,we know what landsin the other person's brain.
Now, the third thing I wantto touch on today is intuition.How often have you seenthese kinds of inspirational memesin your Facebook feed?
Always trust your gut feelingand never second-guess.]
They're nice, right?It's lovely. Yes. "Trust your soul."Well, they're terrible advice.These are some of the bestpoker players in the world right now.Do they look like people who livepurely off feelings and intuitions?
(Laughter)
Look at them!Obviously, these guysare about slow, careful analysis,and that's because the gamehas outgrown the dayswhere pure street smartsand people-readingcan get you to the top.And that's because our intuitionsaren't nearly as perfectas we'd like to believe.I mean, it'd be great,whenever we're in a tough spot,to just have an answer appear to usfrom some magical source of inspiration.But in reality, our gutis extremely vulnerableto all kinds of wishfulthinking and biases.
So then, what is our gut good for?Well, all the studies I've readconclude that it's best-suitedfor everyday thingsthat we have lotsand lots of experience in,like how we just knowthat our friend is mad at usbefore we've even said anything to them,or whether we can fit our carinto a tight parking spot.But when it comes to the really big stuff,like what's our career path going to beor who should we marry,why should we assume that our intuitionsare better calibrated for thesethan slow, proper analysis?I mean, they don't haveany data to be based off.
So my third lesson is,while we shouldn't ignore our intuitions,we shouldn't overprivilege them either.And I'd like to summarizethese three lessons todaywith my own set of memes,with more of a poker-player twist.
"Success is sweetest when you achieve itacross a large sample size."
(Laughter)
"Your gut is your friendand so is a cost-benefit analysis.
(Laughter)
"The future is unknown, but you candamn well try and estimate it."
Thank you.

When trains began to shuttle people across the coutryside,many insisted they would never replace horses.Less than a century later, people repeated that same prediction about cars,telephones,radio,television,and computers.Each had their own host of detractors.Even some experts insisted they wouldn’t catch on.
Of course, we can’t predict exactly what the future will look likeor what new inventions will populate it.But time and time again,we’ve also failed to predict that the technologies of the presentwill change the future.And recent research has revealed a similar pattern in our individual lives:we’re unable to predict change in ourselves.Three psychologists documentedour inability to predict personal changein a 2013 paper called, “The End of History Illusion.”Named after political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s predictionthat liberal democracy was the final form of government,or as he called it, “the end of history,”their work highlights the way we see ourselves as finished productsat any given moment.
The researchers recruited over 7,000 participants ages 18 to 68.They asked half of these participants toreport their current personality traits,values,and preferences,along with what each of those metrics had been ten years before.The other half described those features in their present selves,and predicted what they would be ten years in the future.Based on these answers,the researchers then calculated the degree of changeeach participant reported or predicted.
For every age group in the sample,they compared the predicted changes to the reported changes.So they compared the degree to which 18-year-olds thought they would changeto the degree to which 28-year-olds reported they had changed.Overwhelmingly, at all ages,people’s future estimates of change came up shortcompared to the changes their older counterparts recalled.20-year-olds expected to still like the same foods at 30,but 30-year-olds no longer had the same tastes.30-year-olds predicted they’d still have the same best friend at 40,but 40-year-olds had lost touch with theirs.And 40-year-olds predicted they’d maintain the same core valuesthat 50-year-olds had reconsidered.While older people changed less than younger people on the whole,they underestimated their capacity for change just as much.Wherever we are in life,the end of history illusion persists:we tend to think that the bulk of our personal change is behind us.
One consequence of this thinkingis that we’re inclined to overinvest in future choicesbased on present preferences.On average, people are willing to pay about 60% moreto see their current favorite musician ten years in the futurethan they’d currently pay to see their favorite musician from ten years ago.While the stakes involvedin concert-going are low,we’re susceptible to similar miscalculationsin more serious commitments,like homes,partners,and jobs.At the same time, there’s no real way to predictwhat our preferences will be in the future.Without the end of history Illusion,it would be difficult to make any long-term plans.
So the end of history illusion applies to our individual lives,but what about the wider world?Could we be assuming that how things are now is how they will continue to be?If so, fortunately,there are countless recordsto remind us that the world does change,sometimes for the better.Our own historical moment isn’t the end of history,and that can be just as much a sourceof comfort as a cause for concern.
Jeanie, Will and Adinaare three senior citizensconnected by a special relationship.They view their bond as a shieldfrom the loneliness of aging.
I first met them at a retirementhome in Los Angeles,where I had been photographingfor three years.I saw as they approachedthe gate one night,and felt an immediate connection to them.Although I didn't know the detailsof their love triangle,I intuitively feltthat I had to find out who they were.Questioning a nursea day later, she said to me,"Oh, you're talking about the threesome."
(Laughter)
I was intrigued.
(Laughter)
The trio set out on a daily adventureto coffee and doughnut shops,bus stops and street corners.I soon learned that the purposeof these outings was solaceand a search for meaning.The trio sought to combat their alienationby literally integrating themselvesin public streets.Yet, even when arm in arm,no one saw them.
We often think that as we age,we lose the desires held in our youth.Actually, as a teenage photojournalistwhen I met the trio,I saw their behavior as a mirrorto the fears of exclusionand desires for intimacythat I also carried.I related to their invisibility,which pained me during my childhoodbut has become my greatest assetas an immersive documentarian,because I can just fade into my empathy.As we walked downthe streets of Hollywood,in a neighborhood of screenwriters,actors and filmmakers,the trio assumed the invisibilitythat each senior does.I would ask myself,"How is it that no one elsesees these three human beings?Why is it that I amthe only one who sees them?"
Years later, as I began to sharethis work with the public,I noticed that people are largelyuncomfortable with this story.Perhaps it is because the triodoesn't assume conventional notionsassociated with love,romance or partnership.They were unseen in publicand shunned by their peers.They wanted to belong somewherebut only seemed to belong with each other.I wanted to belong somewhere, too.And my camera has been a catalystfor me to belong everywhere.
But beyond challenging socioculturalnorms about the elderly,the trio sheds lighton fear of remoteness.At the end of each day, they returnto their respective retirement homes.Under the surface of their aloneness,there is a desire for community,for their people.There was a sense that they were eachyearning for their tribe,but that comfort comes with compromise,because Will cannot commit to one woman.
Sitting with Jeanie one dayin her apartment, she said to me,"Sharing Will is a thorn in your side.A relationship between a manand a woman is private.It is a couple, not a trio."
My process is to essentiallybecome the people I documentby spending years with themas an observer-occupant,to create a safe space,to then become hidden in plain sight.
I was about 17 when I met the trio,and I shadowed them for four years.We actually see, in the breakdownof social development,that adolescence and old agelook strikingly alike,because both are periodsof identity confusion.I identified with the women.But also with Will, who made meaware of the divide in me.The schism that we each often haveabout what we craveand the actuality of our situation.
Before shooting this series,I was also in love with two differentpeople who knew about each other,being the object over which they fought.But I also knew what it was liketo be at the base of the triangle,like Jeanie or Adina,asking myself,"Why aren't I enough?"I would look through my viewfinderand see three elderly figures,and it became impossible to denythat regardless of age,we were each in pursuit of fillingthe proverbial hole through other people.
Perhaps the discomfort of lookingat Jeanie, Will and Adina's storyis truly a reminderthat even at the end of life,we may never reach the fantasywe have envisioned for ourselves.Thank you for listening.

I love infographics.As an information designer,I've worked with all sorts of dataover the past 25 years.I have a few insights to share,but first: a little history.
Communication is the encoding,transmission and decoding of information.Breakthroughs in communication markturning points in human culture.Oracy, literacy and numeracywere great developments in communication.They allow us to encode ideas into wordsand quantities into numbers.Without communication, we'd stillbe stuck in the Stone Ages.
Although humans have been aroundfor a quarter million years,it was only 8,000 years agothat proto-writings began to surface.Nearly 3,000 years later, the firstproper writing systems took shape.
Maps have been around for millenniaand diagrams for hundreds of years,but representing quantitiesthrough graphicsis a relatively new development.It wasn't until 1786 that William Playfairinvented the first bar chart,giving birth to visual displayof quantitative information.Fifteen years later, he introducedthe first pie and area charts.His inventions are still the mostcommonly used chart forms today.Florence Nightingale inventedthe coxcomb in 1857for a presentation to Queen Victoriaon troop mortality.Highlighted in blue,she showed how most troops' deathscould have been prevented.Shortly after, Charles Minard chartedNapoleon's march on Moscow,illustrating how an army of 422,000dwindled to just 10,000as battles, geography and freezingtemperatures took their toll.He combined a Sankey diagramwith cartographyand a line chart for temperature.
I get excited when I getlots of data to play with,especially when it yieldsan interesting chart form.Here, Nightingale's coxcombwas the inspirationto organize data on thousandsof federal energy subsidies,scrutinizing the lack of investmentin renewables over fossil fuels.This Sankey diagram illustratesthe flow of energy through the US economy,emphasizing how nearly halfof the energy used is lost as waste heat.
I love it when data can be sculptedinto beautiful shapes.Here, the personal and professionalconnections of the women of Silicon Valleycan be woven into arcs,same as the collaboration of inventorsbirthing patents across the globecan be mapped.
I've even made charts for me.I'm a numbers person,so I rarely win at Scrabble.I made this diagram to rememberall the two- and three-letter wordsin the official Scrabble dictionary.
(Laughter)
Knowing these 1,168 wordscertainly is a game changer.
(Laughter)
Sometimes I produce codeto quickly generate graphicsfrom thousands of data points.Coding also enables meto produce interactive graphics.Now we can navigate informationon our own terms.
Exotic chart forms certainly look cool,but something as simpleas a little dot may be all you needto solve a particular thinking task.In 2006, the "New York Times"redesigned their "Markets" section,cutting it down from eight pagesof stock listingsto just one and a half pagesof essential market data.We listed performance metricsfor the most common stocks,but I wanted to help investorssee how the stocks are doing.So I added a simple little dotto show the current pricerelative to its one-year range.At a glance, value investors can pick outstocks trading near their lowsby looking for dots to the left.Momentum investors can find stockson an upward trajectoryvia dots to the right.Shortly after, the "Wall Street Journal"copied the design.
Simplicity is often the goalfor most graphics,but sometimes we needto embrace complexityand show large data setsin their full glory.Alec Gallup, the former chairmanof the Gallup Organization,once handed me a very thick book.It was his family's legacy:hundreds of pages covering six decadesof presidential approval data.I told him the entire bookcould be graphed on a single page."Impossible," he said.And here it is:25,000 data points on a single page.At a glance, one sees that most presidentsstart with a high approval rating,but few keep it.Events like wars initially boost approval;scandals trigger declines.These major events were annotatedin the graphic but not in the book.The point is, graphics can transmit datawith incredible efficiency.
Graphicacy —the ability to read and write graphics —is still in its infancy.New chart forms will emergeand specialized dialects will evolve.Graphics that help us think fasteror see a book's worthof information on a single pageare the key to unlocking new discoveries.Our visual cortex was builtto decode complex informationand is a master at pattern recognition.Graphicacy enables usto harness our built-in GPUto process mountains of dataand find the veins of gold hiding within.
Thank you.
